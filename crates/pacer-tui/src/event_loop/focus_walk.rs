//! The panel walk: focus moving across the columns — Tab / ⇧Tab and
//! ^⇧L / ^⇧H one panel at a time, `h`/`l` (←/→) as their vim twins —
//! and the double tap that jumps a walk edge: `l`,`l` at Sessions into the
//! pane, `h`,`h` or `k`,`k` up into the Workspaces bar, `j`,`j` back down
//! out of it. `event_loop.rs` dispatches the keys; this module decides
//! where focus lands. The state it drives is `App::focus`, `App::edge_tap`,
//! `App::bar_return` and the pane's input lock.
