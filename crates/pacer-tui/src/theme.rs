//! Color theme: every color the UI draws, keyed by role rather than
//! hardcoded at the call site. The active theme is picked by name in the
//! settings overlay (`theme` in config.json) and lives on `App`, refreshed
//! by the event loop when the setting changes.
//!
//! Presets stick to ANSI-16 and 256-color indexed values so they render
//! everywhere. One exception: `focus_tint` needs a ~10%-opacity accent
//! shade that the 256 palette simply doesn't have (its darkest chromatic
//! steps start around 40%), so it's truecolor RGB — supported by modern
//! terminals including Terminal.app since macOS Tahoe.
