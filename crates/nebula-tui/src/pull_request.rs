//! the conversation, which the daemon keeps (`pr_seen`) so the row can say
//! how many comments landed while they were away.

//! group at the bottom of the worktrees panel (see [`list`]).

//! `gh` may be missing, unauthenticated, or pointed at a repo with no
//! remote; every one of those is an ordinary "no PR" answer, not an error
//! worth a flash. Lookups are async because they hit the network.
