# Dev helpers for working from a checkout. (End users install via install.sh.)
#
# Ways to run code you just wrote:
#   make dev      isolated instance — own daemon, own data; your real sessions untouched
#                 (first run copies your real projects, worktrees, workspaces and
#                 settings in, so it looks like yours — `make dev-reset` re-copies)
#   make browser  the same isolated instance, served into a browser tab via ttyd
#
# Each checkout gets its own instance, keyed to its path, so the main clone and
# every worktree can run at once without sharing a daemon, a DB, or a port.
# `make dev-ls` shows them all.
#   make install  put it in ~/.cargo/bin for real use (then `make kill` to cut over)
#   make cycle    install + kill + dev in one go — the re-runnable full cutover

# The dev instance is a second, complete pacer: its own socket, DB, and
# settings — and one *per checkout*, so the main clone and every worktree can
# run at the same time. Sharing them is worse than a port clash: two checkouts
# on one runtime dir means the second TUI silently attaches to the first's
# daemon and you drive the other checkout's binary, while `dev-prep` below
# SIGTERMs whichever daemon got there first.
#
# The slot is the checkout's directory name plus a hash of its absolute path,
# so two worktrees with the same name in different repos still separate. The
# runtime dir takes the hash alone — it holds a unix socket, and SUN_LEN (104
# bytes on macOS) is not a budget a long worktree name should be spending.

# instance stays as isolated as `make dev`. Needs ttyd on PATH — the binary

# A blank dev instance is useless for eyeballing a change — you'd re-add every

# the real daemon owns, and the dev daemon must not resume them. `.backup`
# reads the WAL, so the copy is consistent even with the real daemon running.
# The real dir is where `directories::ProjectDirs::from("dev","pacer","pacer")`
# puts it (pacer-core/src/paths.rs). Keep the two in step.

# --- installing for real use -------------------------------------------------

build: ## Release build
	cargo build --release

# The cp+mv two-step is load-bearing on macOS: overwriting the installed
# binary in place reuses its inode, and the kernel's cached code signature
# for that inode no longer matches the new contents — every exec then dies
# with SIGKILL (exit 137). A fresh inode forces signature re-validation.
install: build ## Install to $(PREFIX) — warns if the live daemon is now stale
	cp $(RELEASE_BIN) $(PREFIX)/pacer.new
	mv $(PREFIX)/pacer.new $(PREFIX)/pacer
	@$(PREFIX)/pacer --version
	@$(PREFIX)/pacer _stale-daemon-note

kill: ## Stop every session and the daemon — the cutover step after `make install`
	$(PREFIX)/pacer kill

# The whole cutover as one command, safe to re-run as often as you like:
# install first, so a build that fails stops here with every session still
# alive; then kill the real daemon (it is now running the old binary — the
# STALE DAEMON NOTE `install` just printed says as much); then `dev`, which
# builds the debug binary and hands the terminal to the isolated dev instance.
# `pacer kill` exits 0 and says "no pacer daemon running" when there is
# nothing to stop, so the first run on a cold machine goes through too. The
# kill stops every real session — run this from a terminal outside pacer,
# not from a session it would take down with it. Recipe lines rather than
# prerequisites so `make -j` cannot reorder the three.

# --- checks ------------------------------------------------------------------

check: ## Typecheck the workspace (fastest feedback)
	cargo check --workspace --all-targets

fmt: ## Format the workspace
	cargo fmt --all

# Not `-D warnings` by default: the workspace does not currently clear that
# bar (pre-existing lints in config.rs, ui.rs, and hooks/mod.rs), and CI runs
# no clippy at all. `make lint STRICT=1` opts into the stricter gate.
lint: ## Clippy over the workspace (STRICT=1 to fail on warnings)
	cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets $(if $(STRICT),-- -D warnings)

test: ## Full test suite (e2e_pty spawns real daemons — slow)
	cargo test --workspace

ci: ## The whole gate: fmt check, clippy, tests
	cargo fmt --all -- --check
	@$(MAKE) --no-print-directory lint
	@$(MAKE) --no-print-directory test

clean: ## Remove build artifacts
	cargo clean
