# Nebula Terms

The shared vocabulary for this project — one **ALL-CAPS canonical name** per feature, panel, key,
command, hook route, daemon mechanism, status and dev workflow. Teammates, agents and sessions all use
these names, spelled exactly as they appear here, so "the thing at the top" and "the top nav" and
"the workspace header tabs" all resolve to the one row that says WORKSPACES BAR and points at the code.

How to read a row:

| TERM | What it is | Also called | Where · key |
|---|---|---|---|
| **THE NAME** | One or two sentences, present tense. Other TERMS it depends on are in caps. | words the user has actually typed for it, verbatim | `file::symbol` · default key · `nebula sub` · env var |

Rules: one TERM per thing, one thing per TERM; aliases are quoted from real prompts; *Where* is
greppable and was verified when written. Code identifiers are not renamed to match TERMS — the glossary
points at them. The **Alias index** at the bottom is the fast path from a user's word to its TERM; a
word that maps to two TERMS is listed under both, because that is the ambiguity to settle before
working. A name seen in only one task is not yet a TERM: it waits in the **Candidates** ledger
(section 14) and is promoted only when a later, separate task uses it again. Maintained by the
`project-terms` skill (`.claude/skills/project-terms/SKILL.md`); history and gotchas live in
`.claude/MEMORY.md`, not here.

## 1. The tree

Everything nests: WORKSPACE → PROJECT → WORKTREE → SESSION. The DAEMON owns the tree; the TUI draws it.

| TERM | What it is | Also called | Where · key |
|---|---|---|---|
| **WORKSPACE** | A named group of PROJECTS. Exactly one is the OPEN WORKSPACE per TUI instance; the others keep running in the background. Every install has the DEFAULT WORKSPACE. | "workspace", "workspaces" | `nebula-core/src/entities.rs::Workspace` · `nebula workspace …` |
| **OPEN WORKSPACE** | The WORKSPACE this TUI window is scoped to — what the PROJECTS PANEL lists. Per window: two `nebula` instances can sit on two workspaces. Switched by the WORKSPACE SWITCHER, the WORKSPACES BAR, `/`, or `nebula workspace open`. | "selected workspace", "current workspace", "they both seem to switch workspaces when one does" | `nebula-tui/src/app.rs::Tree::active_workspace_name` · `--workspace <name>` |
| **STARTUP WORKSPACE** | `nebula --workspace <name>` boots this instance on a named WORKSPACE; the open workspace is pinned per client connection at `Subscribe`, so two TUIs never switch each other (`nebula workspace open` only sets what the *next* instance opens into). | "each new nebula instance can point to a different workspace", "per-connection workspace" | `event_loop.rs::apply_startup_workspace` · `server.rs::handle_client` |
| **DEFAULT WORKSPACE** | The built-in WORKSPACE named `default` that every install starts with and can never delete. | — | `nebula-core/src/ids.rs::DEFAULT_WORKSPACE_ID` |
| **PROJECT** | A git checkout registered with nebula (`nebula add <dir>`), named after its root directory, filed under whichever WORKSPACE was open. | "repo", "project" | `entities.rs::Project` · `nebula add` · `n` in PROJECTS PANEL, `o` anywhere |
| **WORKTREE** | Where a SESSION runs: the ROOT WORKTREE or a real `git worktree` created under the WORKTREE DIR. Two agents in two worktrees never collide. | "worktree", "branch" | `entities.rs::Worktree` · `n` in WORKTREES PANEL |
| **ROOT WORKTREE** | The PROJECT's own checkout — the worktree row badged ROOT BADGE (`⌂ root`). Every project has exactly one. | "root worktree row", "main checkout", "the checkout", "root row", "main root worktree", "main worktree root" | `ui.rs::draw_worktrees` (`ROOT_BADGE`) |
| **WORKTREE DIR** | The convention for new worktrees: `<repo>/../<repo-name>-worktrees/<branch>` (`/` in the branch becomes `-`). Claude's own `EnterWorktree` lands elsewhere (`<repo>/.claude/worktrees/`), which is why WORKTREE RELOCATION exists. | "<project>-worktrees", "sibling of my project dir" | `nebula-daemon/src/git.rs::worktree_dir` |
| **BRANCH NAME GENERATOR** | A new WORKTREE's name is slugified from whatever you type (`fix login redirect` → `fix-login-redirect`); an empty prompt takes a random `<adj>-<noun>-<verb>`. | "random branch name using three words", "slugify" | `nebula-tui/src/branch_name.rs` |
| **WORKTREE DELETE** | `d` on a WORKTREE takes a typed confirm (files go), applies optimistically with a rollback PENDING INTENT, and force-unlocks a stale `git worktree` lock (usually Claude's own `EnterWorktree`). | "delete the worktree", "cannot remove a locked working tree" | `app.rs::PendingIntent::DeleteWorktree`, `WorktreeRollback` |
| **SESSION** | One row in the SESSIONS PANEL: an AGENT or a TERMINAL SESSION, bound to a WORKTREE, backed by a PTY SESSION in the DAEMON. | "session", "terminal", "tab" | `entities.rs::Agent` / `Terminal` |
| **AGENT** | A SESSION running an agent CLI (`claude`, `codex`, `cursor-agent`) — see AGENT KIND. Restored with RESUME. | "agent", "claude code session", "the claude" | `entities.rs::Agent` · `n` in SESSIONS PANEL |
| **PR SESSION** | A Claude AGENT created from a PROJECT OPEN PRS GROUP row (`n`, or the CONTEXT MENU's **New Claude session**), started in the ROOT WORKTREE. The DAEMON persists the PR URL (`agents.pr_url`, MIGRATION 22), refuses a PREWARM POOL adoption for it, and composes a PR-only work rule plus the URL into `--append-system-prompt` on every spawn and RESUME (`CreatePrAgent`, PROTOCOL VERSION 30). | "pr session", "new claude session" (on a PR row), "sessions off of the open prs rows" | `protocol.rs::ClientRequest::CreatePrAgent` · `registry.rs::claude_pr_system_prompt` · `event_loop.rs::open_pr_agent_picker` |
| **TERMINAL SESSION** | A SESSION that is a plain shell in the WORKTREE's directory, not an agent. Listed under the TERMINALS group. | "shell", "terminal tab" | `entities.rs::Terminal` · `t` |
| **LINK** | A URL previously pinned to a WORKTREE and stored daemon-side, normalised to http(s). Existing rows remain visible and editable in the WORKTREE OPEN PRS GROUP, but the TUI no longer creates them. | "link", "attach a link", "add links manually" | `entities.rs::Link` |
| **PR ROW** | The pull request open on a WORKTREE's branch, found client-side with `gh pr view` on the GIT POLL and shown first in the WORKTREE OPEN PRS GROUP as a row nothing stores — opens, can't be edited or deleted; while the SESSIONS PANEL has FOCUS on it the TERMINAL PANE shows its PR PREVIEW and `g` shows its diff. Carries an unread-comment count. | "the PR", "pull request row", "pull request link", "NEW comments", "pull request in the session row" | `nebula-tui/src/pull_request.rs` · `app.rs::LinkRow` |
| **PROJECT OPEN PRS GROUP** | The `OPEN PRS · n` group at the bottom of the WORKTREES PANEL: every PR still open on the repo (drafts badged), from one `gh pr list` per PROJECT every 15 s, pulled forward (5 s floor) when the WORKTREES PANEL or SESSIONS PANEL takes FOCUS or the terminal window regains it. Resting on one shows the PR PREVIEW; `g` shows its diff; `n` (or the CONTEXT MENU's **New Claude session**) starts a Claude AGENT in the ROOT WORKTREE whose system prompt scopes all work to that PR. | "open prs", "open pr list", "open pull requests", "open prs rows", "prs on worktree list" | `app.rs::OpenPrs` · `ui.rs::draw_worktrees` |
| **WORKTREE OPEN PRS GROUP** | The `OPEN PRS` group in the SESSIONS PANEL: the selected WORKTREE's PR ROW followed by previously saved LINK rows. Resting on the PR ROW with FOCUS there shows the PR PREVIEW. Manual LINK creation is not exposed. | "links", "open prs" | `ui.rs::draw_sessions` |
| **SESSION GROUPS** | The SESSIONS PANEL's headers: the AGENTS come first as one header-less list in RECENCY ORDER, then TERMINALS, OPEN PRS, ARCHIVED (hidden until `Shift+A`, see ARCHIVE). The WORKTREES PANEL has only its checkouts and OPEN PRS. PINNED / RECENT / UNPINNED were retired with PIN and the RECENT WINDOW. | "the groups", "the recent label" | `ui.rs::draw_sessions` |
| **ARCHIVE** | Archiving an AGENT releases its PTY and moves it to the ARCHIVED group; UNARCHIVE brings it back (RESUME on next attach). | "archive", "archived" | `Action::Archive` / `Unarchive` / `ToggleArchived` · `a` / `u` / `Shift+A` |

## 2. Processes and plumbing

| TERM | What it is | Also called | Where · key |
|---|---|---|---|
| **DAEMON** | The detached `nebula daemon` process that owns every PTY SESSION, the SQLITE STORE, git, the HOOK RECEIVER and agent status. Auto-spawned by the TUI with `setsid` so it outlives the client. | "daemon", "the background process" | `crates/nebula-daemon` · `nebula daemon [--foreground]` |
| **TUI** | The ratatui client (bare `nebula`) that attaches to the DAEMON over the DAEMON SOCKET. Quitting it kills nothing. | "the ui", "nebula", "the app" | `crates/nebula-tui` |
| **DAEMON SOCKET** | `<RUNTIME DIR>/daemon.sock`, mode 0700 — the unix socket the TUI and one-shot CLI clients connect to. | "the socket" | `nebula-core/src/paths.rs::socket_path` |
| **RUNTIME DIR** | Socket + PIDFILE directory: `$NEBULA_RUNTIME_DIR`, else `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/nebula`, else `/tmp/nebula-<uid>`. | — | `paths.rs::runtime_dir` |
| **DATA DIR** | Where the SQLITE STORE, CONFIG.JSON, REVIEWED.JSON and the SSH HOSTS file live: `$NEBULA_DATA_DIR` or the platform app-support dir (`~/.local/share/nebula`, `~/Library/Application Support/dev.nebula.nebula`). | "data dir" | `paths.rs::data_dir` · `NEBULA_DATA_DIR` |
| **DAEMON LOG** | `daemon.log` (beside `tui.log`) in the state dir — `~/.local/state/nebula/`, or `<DATA DIR>/state` when `NEBULA_DATA_DIR` is set. `NEBULA_LOG=debug` for more. No `daemon.log` at all means the daemon never started. | "daemon.log", "the logs" | `paths.rs::daemon_log_path` · `NEBULA_LOG` |
| **SQLITE STORE** | `nebula.db` in the DATA DIR: workspaces, projects, worktrees, agents (kind + CLI session id + the `pr_url` an OPEN PRS launch carries), terminals, links, `pr_seen`, `ui_state`. Schema advanced by MIGRATIONS. | "the db", "sqlite" | `nebula-daemon/src/store.rs::Store` |
| **MIGRATION** | A numbered `PRAGMA user_version` step in the store (22 so far). Adding a column = a migration; adding a field to an entity usually also = a PROTOCOL VERSION bump. | "migration" | `store.rs::MIGRATIONS` |
| **PIDFILE LOCK** | `flock` on `<RUNTIME DIR>/daemon.pid` is daemon liveness; clients probe it by trying the lock. | "pidfile" | `nebula-daemon/src/lifecycle.rs::PidfileLock` |
| **BUILDSTAMP** | A content hash of the running daemon binary written to `daemon.build` at start. Installers compare it to detect a stale daemon (STALE DAEMON NOTE); it cannot name the binary's path. | "buildstamp" | `lifecycle.rs::write_buildstamp` · `paths.rs::buildstamp_path` |
| **PROTOCOL VERSION** | `PROTOCOL_VERSION` (33) exchanged in the HANDSHAKE. Frames are positional msgpack, so any new field on a shared struct bumps it. Two branches that each bump it merge to the *same* number — diff it against `origin/main` before a release commit. | "protocol", "v26/v27/v28/v29/v30/v32" | `nebula-core/src/protocol.rs::PROTOCOL_VERSION` |
| **HANDSHAKE** | `Hello{protocol_version}` → `HelloOk{daemon_pid}` or `Incompatible`, then `Subscribe` → `Snapshot`. | "handshake" | `protocol.rs` · `nebula-daemon/src/server.rs::handle_client` |
| **VERSION SKEW** | A DAEMON and a client built from different PROTOCOL VERSIONS. The client's message names both binaries and says which side is older: `make install` when the client is, `nebula kill` when the daemon is. | "daemon speaks protocol v26, this client v24", "the hook still seems to fail" | `nebula-tui/src/ipc.rs::version_skew_message` |
| **CLIENT REQUEST** | The request family the TUI sends: Attach, Input, Resize, CRUD on every entity, `MarkAgentSeen`, `GetMetrics`, `Shutdown`, … | — | `protocol.rs::ClientRequest` |
| **SERVER EVENT** | The event family the DAEMON pushes: `Snapshot`, `EntityUpserted`/`EntityRemoved` (deltas), `StatusChanged{unseen}`, `Scrollback`, `Output`, `SessionExited`, `KittyFlags`, `Metrics`. | "delta", "upsert" | `protocol.rs::ServerEvent` |
| **IPC CODEC** | Length-prefixed MessagePack frames over the DAEMON SOCKET, 4 MiB max. | "msgpack", "rmp" | `nebula-core/src/codec.rs` |
| **ATTACH** | The TUI's `Attach{session, from_seq, cols, rows}`: the DAEMON replays the SCROLLBACK RING as `Scrollback`, then streams `Output`. Detach never kills the child. Every path that lands the pane on a SESSION goes through `attach()`, which is where MARK SEEN fires. | "attach", "drill in" | `nebula-tui/src/event_loop.rs::attach` · `Enter` |
| **PTY SESSION** | The DAEMON-owned PTY child for one SESSION: reader thread, output coalescing, SIGHUP-then-SIGKILL on kill, plus the PROGRESS SCANNER, KITTY SCANNER and CLOUD SCANNER on its stream. | "the pty" | `nebula-daemon/src/pty/mod.rs::PtySession` |
| **SCROLLBACK RING** | 1 MiB per-PTY byte ring with monotonic seqs so a reattach is gap-free and the pane comes back with its history. | "scrollback" | `pty/ring.rs::ScrollbackRing` |
| **AGENT ENV** | `NEBULA_AGENT_ID` / `NEBULA_API_URL` / `NEBULA_API_TOKEN` set on AGENT PTYs (and scrubbed from TERMINAL SESSIONS) — how hooks and `nebula rename` / `nebula worktree` / `nebula spawn` know which row they are. | — | `registry.rs::scrubbed_env_names` |
| **METRICS SNAPSHOT** | One machine-wide `ps` sweep summed per SESSION process tree (plus the daemon itself and the WARM SPARES), for the MEMORY MODAL and the FOOTER's WARM COUNT. | "memory usage" | `nebula-daemon/src/metrics.rs::collect` · `protocol.rs::MetricsSnapshot` |
| **CRASH LOG** | Panic hook appending backtraces to the log file. | — | `nebula-core/src/crashlog.rs` |
| **UI STATE BLOB** | The per-client layout/selection JSON (`UiState`) the TUI sends to the DAEMON on quit only — anything that must survive a crash goes in CONFIG.JSON instead. Restored at startup after the STARTUP WORKSPACE is applied. | "ui state", "last selection" | `app.rs::UiState` · `ClientRequest::SaveUiState` |
| **DAEMON SETSID** | The TUI spawns the DAEMON with `setsid` (a new *session*, not just a process group) so it has no controlling tty: a daemon child that could reach `/dev/tty` would write into the TUI. | "keeps writing strange tokens and the entire app is broken" | `nebula-tui/src/ipc.rs::spawn_daemon` |
| **VENDORED VT100** | `vendor/vt100`, wired in via `[patch.crates-io]`, with one patch: rows scrolled out of a top-anchored scroll region go to scrollback, so wheel-up over a codex session has something to show. | "vt100", "the parser", "scrolling back using codex doesn't work" | `vendor/vt100` · `Cargo.toml` |

## 3. Layout — what is on screen

| TERM | What it is | Also called | Where · key |
|---|---|---|---|
| **WORKSPACES BAR** | The optional tab strip across the top: `WORKSPACES` on the left, then one WORKSPACE TAB per workspace. Its cursor *is* the OPEN WORKSPACE. Shown/hidden by TOGGLE WORKSPACES BAR; the choice is the `Workspaces bar` setting. | "top nav", "workspaces top bar", "top bar", "header", "workspace header tabs", "the tab bar", "workspaces panel", "that entire panel", "the workspaces", "jump up to the workspaces" | `ui.rs::draw_workspaces_bar` · `app.rs::Focus::Workspaces` · `Shift+W` |
| **WORKSPACE TAB** | One tab in the WORKSPACES BAR: the workspace name, its ROLLUP STATUS DOT and a DONE BADGE count. Selectable by SELECT WORKSPACE N. | "tab", "header workspace name" | `ui.rs::draw_workspaces_bar` · `1`–`9` |
| **TAB UNDERLINE** | The accent `▀` under the open WORKSPACE TAB, flush with the tab's fill (a `━` left a half-cell gap). | "the bottom bar", "the underline", "gap under the tab" | `ui.rs::draw_workspaces_bar` |
| **PROJECTS PANEL** | Optional leftmost column, listing the OPEN WORKSPACE's PROJECTS. Its header reads `PROJECTS` while the WORKSPACES BAR is shown and the workspace's name (upper-cased) when it is hidden. | "projects list", "projects column", "projects", "projects worktrees and sessions lists" | `ui.rs::draw_projects` · `Focus::Projects` · `Config::hide_projects` · `Shift+P` |
| **WORKTREES PANEL** | Optional middle column: the selected PROJECT's WORKTREES in RECENCY ORDER plus the PROJECT OPEN PRS GROUP. | "worktrees column", "worktrees list", "worktrees row" | `ui.rs::draw_worktrees` · `Focus::Worktrees` · `Config::hide_worktrees` · `Shift+B` |
| **SESSIONS PANEL** | Always-visible third column: the selected WORKTREE's SESSIONS in SESSION GROUPS, plus the WORKTREE OPEN PRS GROUP. | "sessions list", "sessions column", "session list", "sessions", "recent list", "focused on the session" | `ui.rs::draw_sessions` · `Focus::Sessions` |
| **RECENCY ORDER** | How every list column orders itself: PROJECTS, WORKTREES and live SESSIONS sit most-recently-interacted first, a RUNNING session counting as now, never-run rows keeping tree order at the bottom. There is no manual reorder (MOVE PROJECT is retired) and no PIN (retired); the AGO BADGE shows the stamp. | "recent to top", "order by last interaction", "goes to top of list", "always just move recent to top", "recent at the top", "time stamps" | `app.rs::Recency` · `last_interaction_ms` · `project_rows` · `visible_worktrees` · `visible_sessions` |
| **TERMINAL PANE** | The right-hand pane showing the attached SESSION (title `TERMINAL`), or the PR PREVIEW (`PULL REQUEST`). Its chips: `INPUT` (LOCKED PANE), `scroll N`, `exited`. | "terminal panel", "the pane", "the terminal", "claude code session", "focused session terminal" | `ui.rs::draw_terminal` · `Focus::Terminal` |
| **PANEL** | A focusable screen region: the optional PROJECTS PANEL and WORKTREES PANEL, the always-visible SESSIONS PANEL, or the TERMINAL PANE. Sidebar widths are draggable and remembered while hidden; the WORKSPACES BAR is a separate top strip. | "panel", "column", "sidebar" | `app.rs::Focus` · `app.rs::App::panel_widths` |
| **PR PREVIEW** | The TERMINAL PANE rendering a pull request's description, stats and conversation as wrapped text while a cursor rests on it — a PROJECT OPEN PRS GROUP row, or the PR ROW while the SESSIONS PANEL has FOCUS (focusing the pane brings the attached session back). Only the row you stop on is fetched, once per URL. | "pr preview", "read the PR in the pane", "show the contents of the PR directly in nebula", "hover over a PR", "pr description on the right" | `nebula-tui/src/pr_preview.rs` |
| **FOOTER** | The bottom bar: `⏻ connected` / `✗ disconnected`, per-FOCUS key hints, restore hints for a hidden PROJECTS PANEL or WORKTREES PANEL, flash messages, the NAMEPLATE, hostname, and the agents / terms / WARM COUNT tallies. | "footer", "bottom bar", "status bar", "bottom left" | `ui.rs::draw_footer` · `app.rs::ConnState` |
| **WORKSPACE NAMEPLATE** | The `◇ workspace` chip bottom-left of the FOOTER; clicking it opens the WORKSPACE SWITCHER. | "nameplate", "workspace chip" | `ui.rs::draw_footer_bar` · `app.rs::HitTarget::FooterWorkspace` |
| **VERSION NAMEPLATE** | The `nebula vX.Y.Z` at the FOOTER's left edge (18 columns; yields only to a FLASH). Same source as `nebula --version`. | "version number of nebula in the bottom bar" | `ui.rs::draw_footer` · `CARGO_PKG_VERSION` |
| **FLASH** | A transient FOOTER message (`copied N chars (via terminal)`, an error from the daemon). | "flash", "the toast" | `app.rs::App::flash` · `event_loop.rs::copy_and_flash` |
| **SPLASH** | The animated nebula shown while the tree is empty (`n` adds a project from it), replayable with Shift+N. | "splash", "startup screen", "nebula splash screen", "nebula landing screen" | `nebula-tui/src/splash.rs` · `Shift+N` |
| **PILL ROW** | A sidebar row drawn as a 3-row pill (pad, text, pad) on a 2-row stride, with an accent rail when selected. Hit-tested over its whole drawn height. | "row", "pill", "clickable zone", "row itself", "black bars top and bottom" | `ui.rs::PILL_H`, `pill_hit_height` |
| **ROW BADGES** | The trailing decorations on a PROJECT / WORKTREE row: the DONE BADGE and, on the ROOT WORKTREE, the ROOT BADGE. The badge yields to a branch name it would otherwise truncate. | "badge", "counter" | `ui.rs::row_badges` |
| **FOCUS TINT** | The dark gray floor, leaning faintly toward the accent, painted over every untouched cell of the focused PANEL (truecolor; each theme preset carries its own, kept above a black floor by a test since issue #6). Setting `focus_tint`. | "focused-panel tint", "focus terminal setting", "lightly colored (like 10% opacity) theme color" | `theme.rs::Theme::focus_tint` · `ui.rs::draw_focus_tint` |
| **STATUS SWEEP** | The bright band sweeping across a RUNNING (yellow) or NEEDS FEEDBACK (red) session name. Off with `animations: false`. | "the animation", "the shimmer", "make the text animate", "sweeping animation", "yellow animation" | `ui.rs::sweep_ramp` · `theme.rs::warn_sweep`/`err_sweep` |
| **THEME** | The color preset: `default` (cyan), `ocean`, `forest`, `rose`, `amber`. Each defines the THEME ROLES. | "theme", "color scheme" | `nebula-tui/src/theme.rs::THEMES` · `"theme"` setting |
| **THEME ROLES** | The named colors a THEME provides: `accent`, `text`, `muted`, `dim`, `ok` (green), `done` (violet), `warn` (yellow), `err` (red), `special` (magenta), `sel_bg`, `edge`, `focus_tint`, the sweeps. `done` must differ from `ok` in every preset. | "theme role", "th.ok" | `theme.rs::Theme` |

## 4. Status and badges

| TERM | What it is | Also called | Where · key |
|---|---|---|---|
| **AGENT STATUS** | The DAEMON-owned state of an AGENT: FRESH, RUNNING, FINISHED, NEEDS FEEDBACK, TERMINATED, DISCONNECTED. Driven by the STATUS MACHINE. | "status", "state" | `nebula-core/src/entities.rs::AgentStatus` |
| **FRESH** | Gray ● — the agent has never run a turn. | "gray", "fresh" | `AgentStatus::Fresh` |
| **RUNNING** | Yellow ● — a turn is in progress (Stop is held by the STOP GATE while subagents are active). | "yellow", "running", "mid-turn", "thinking" | `AgentStatus::Running` |
| **FINISHED** | The turn completed. Draws violet while UNSEEN and green (`ok`) once read. | "done", "green", "finished", "the done status", "goes into the done status" | `AgentStatus::Finished` |
| **NEEDS FEEDBACK** | Red ● — a permission prompt or question is waiting on you. Cursor agents never reach it (no permission hook, `--force`). | "red", "needs feedback", "waiting on me", "permission prompt", "awaiting-feedback" | `AgentStatus::NeedsFeedback` |
| **TERMINATED** | Magenta ● — the process died mid-run. | "terminated", "died" | `AgentStatus::Terminated` |
| **DISCONNECTED** | ○ — the DAEMON restarted while the agent was live (BOOT SWEEP marks these). | "disconnected" | `AgentStatus::Disconnected` · `store.rs::sweep_disconnected` |
| **UNSEEN** | The DAEMON-owned flag on an AGENT meaning "a turn finished and nobody has looked at it": raised on RUNNING/NEEDS FEEDBACK → FINISHED, cleared by MARK SEEN, never raised on archived rows. It is the axis the DONE BADGE counts and the violet STATUS DOT keys off — *not* the same thing as FINISHED. | "done", "unread", "not yet read", "needs to be addressed", "yellow to green", "track when a session goes from yellow to green" | `entities.rs::Agent::unseen` · `store.rs::set_agent_status` |
| **MARK SEEN** | Clearing UNSEEN: the TUI sends `MarkAgentSeen` from `attach()` and when a `StatusChanged` lands on the session already in the pane; the daemon re-broadcasts only on a real flip. | "read it", "focus on the session" | `event_loop.rs::mark_agent_seen` · `registry.rs::mark_agent_seen` |
| **STATUS DOT** | The colored ● before a row name: gray FRESH, yellow RUNNING, violet FINISHED+UNSEEN, green FINISHED read, red NEEDS FEEDBACK, magenta TERMINATED, ○ DISCONNECTED. | "status dot", "the dot", "the color" | `ui.rs::status_dot(status, unseen, th)` |
| **ROLLUP** | Parent rows (WORKTREE, PROJECT, WORKSPACE TAB) show their children's worst STATUS DOT: red beats yellow beats done, and violet whenever anything UNSEEN is underneath. | "rolled-up status", "parent dot" | `app.rs::project_unseen` / `worktree_unseen` / `workspace_unseen` |
| **DONE BADGE** | The violet ` n done` on PROJECT / WORKTREE rows and WORKSPACE TABS, and the ` done` that replaces a session row's HARNESS BADGE — the count of UNSEEN finishes under it. Counts down as you read. Read ` n new` before 2026-08-27. | "done", "2 done", "new", "counter", "notification counts", "the number", "counter in the projects, worktrees row", "how many terminals I need to check" | `ui.rs::unseen_badge` |
| **HARNESS BADGE** | The dim AGENT KIND after a session name (`claude` / `codex` / `cursor`); gives way to ` done` while UNSEEN, and reads CLOUD BADGE on cloud rows. | "harness", "the claude label" | `ui.rs::draw_session_row` |
| **CLOUD BADGE** | ` cloud` on a CLOUD SESSION row; ` cloud ↻` while the CLOUD MIRROR is following. | "cloud badge" | `ui.rs::draw_session_row` · `Agent::cloud_mirroring` |
| **ROOT BADGE** | ` ⌂ root` on the ROOT WORKTREE row. Decoration: it shrinks to the bare ` ⌂` (the default 22-column WORKTREES PANEL shows `main ⌂ 23m ago`) and then drops, before the branch name would truncate. | "root" | `ui.rs::ROOT_BADGE` / `ROOT_GLYPH` |
| **AGO BADGE** | Dim `23m ago` after a SESSION, WORKTREE or PROJECT name — the row's last-interaction stamp (`status_changed_at`; a worktree or project carries the newest stamp of the sessions under it). Never-run rows stay bare, and the label drops before a name would fall under 8 columns. It is what makes the RECENCY ORDER legible. | "ago", "23m ago", "time last interacted", "time last updated timestamp", "last updated" | `ui.rs::ago_badge` · `fit_ago` · `app.rs::Recency` |
| **WARM COUNT** | ` · N warm` in the FOOTER: the WARM SPARES in the PREWARM POOL, counted apart from agents. | "warm" | `ui.rs::draw_footer_bar` |
| **DRAFT BADGE** | The `draft` mark on a draft PR in the PROJECT OPEN PRS GROUP. | "draft" | `ui.rs::draw_worktrees` |
| **STATUS MACHINE** | The per-agent pure state machine turning HOOK EVENTS and PROGRESS into AGENT STATUS: the STOP GATE with its 180 s drain and 30 min quiet graces, a 30 s subagent heal window, foreign session ids ignored. | "status engine", "state machine" | `nebula-daemon/src/status.rs::AgentStatusMachine` |
| **STOP GATE** | A `Stop` hook — and, since 2026-08-28, an IDLE PROMPT — is held while `SubagentStart`s outnumber `SubagentStop`s, so a turn is not FINISHED while background workers still run; the 180 s drain grace releases it once they stop, and the 30 min quiet grace (`SUBAGENT_QUIET_GRACE`, reset by any subagent hook traffic) presumes them orphaned when no SubagentStop ever comes (a `TaskStop`-killed worker sends none). | "stop is gated on subagents", "subagents off that main session should keep the status yellow", "the session turns green" | `status.rs::DRAIN_GRACE`, `SUBAGENT_QUIET_GRACE`, `SUBAGENT_TTL` |
| **PROGRESS SCANNER** | Reads OSC 9;4 busy/idle escapes off the PTY — the only end-of-turn signal after a user cancel (Esc fires no Stop), and one that stays busy during a permission prompt. | "progress bar", "osc 9;4", "cancel Claude code never changed the status back to green" | `nebula-daemon/src/pty/progress.rs::ProgressScanner` |
| **IDLE PROMPT** | Claude's `Notification{idle_prompt}` hook event, which un-sticks a RUNNING turn that never sent Stop. A cancel suppresses it too — and it fires ~60 s into a turn whose Agent-tool subagents are still running in the background, so it holds under the STOP GATE rather than finishing while any are tracked. | "idle_prompt", "idle notification" | `status.rs::mark_idle` |

## 5. Focus, navigation and keys

| TERM | What it is | Also called | Where · key |
|---|---|---|---|
| **FOCUS** | Which visible stop has the cursor: the WORKSPACES BAR, PROJECTS PANEL, WORKTREES PANEL, SESSIONS PANEL, or TERMINAL PANE. Hidden panels cannot own FOCUS. Moving the cursor onto a SESSION previews it (ATTACH) and reads it (MARK SEEN). | "focus", "the cursor" | `app.rs::Focus` · `App::focus_visible` |
| **PANEL WALK** | Moving FOCUS with FOCUS NEXT / FOCUS PREV (Tab / Shift+Tab, `Ctrl+Shift+L` / `Ctrl+Shift+H`). It skips hidden panels; forward stops at the TERMINAL PANE and locks it (LOCKED PANE), while backward stops at the WORKSPACES BAR when shown or the first visible sidebar. Neither direction cycles or wraps. | "the walk", "the nav", "cycle the nav", "control shift h or l", "tab through the panels", "navigation keys to toggle through", "h and l should be for left and right" | `event_loop/focus_walk.rs::walk_focus_forward` / `walk_focus_back` · `App::next_visible_focus` / `previous_visible_focus` · `Tab` / `Shift+Tab` |
| **WALK EDGE** | The place where a single move key is a no-op and a DOUBLE TAP jumps the boundary: the SESSIONS PANEL (or an unlocked TERMINAL PANE) going right, the first visible sidebar going left, a panel's first row going up (`k`/↑, while the WORKSPACES BAR is shown), and the WORKSPACES BAR going down (`j`/↓). Hidden panels are never an edge. | "locked layer", "the edge", "the end of the row", "blocked boundary", "at the first" | `event_loop.rs::Action::FocusLeft` / `FocusRight` / `MoveUp` / `MoveDown` · `event_loop/focus_walk.rs::at_top_row` |
| **DOUBLE TAP** | Two presses of the same move key within `DOUBLE_TAP` (400 ms) at a WALK EDGE: `l`,`l` at Sessions enters and locks the pane like FOCUS NEXT; `h`,`h` at the first visible sidebar or `k`,`k` on a panel's first row steps up into the WORKSPACES BAR (only while shown); `j`,`j` in the bar drops back onto the panel focus came up from, cursor untouched (the first visible sidebar if it never came up, or if that panel has since been hidden). The first press stays put and flashes "`l` again: enter pane" / "`k` again: workspaces" / "`j` again: back to sessions"; any other key in between, or a slower second press, breaks the pair. The arrows share the actions, so ←/→/↑/↓ get it too. | "double tap", "double tap h or l", "jump over that blocked boundary", "second press", "double tap k", "double tab j" | `event_loop/focus_walk.rs::double_tapped` · `DOUBLE_TAP` · `app.rs::App::edge_tap` · `App::bar_return` |
| **FOCUS NEXT / FOCUS PREV** | The keymap actions behind the PANEL WALK. | "tab", "shift tab" | `keymap.rs::Action::FocusNext` / `FocusPrev` · `Tab`, `Ctrl+Shift+L` / `Shift+Tab`, `Ctrl+Shift+H` |
| **FOCUS LEFT / FOCUS RIGHT** | One visible panel left / right; hidden panels are skipped. The letters and arrows are the same action, so a change to `h`/`l` changes `←`/`→`. In the WORKSPACES BAR, `←`/`→` switch tabs instead. | "h and l", "the arrows" | `keymap.rs::Action::FocusLeft` / `FocusRight` · `h`/`←`, `l`/`→` |
| **MOVE UP / MOVE DOWN** | Move the selection inside the focused PANEL. On a panel's first row (`k`) and in the WORKSPACES BAR (`j`) they are at a WALK EDGE: one press stays put, a DOUBLE TAP jumps. | "j and k", "press k to toggle up", "toggle up" | `Action::MoveUp` / `MoveDown` · `k`/`↑`, `j`/`↓` |
| **ACTIVATE** | Enter: drill into the next visible panel, ATTACH a session (and lock the pane), open a LINK, or step down from the WORKSPACES BAR. | "enter", "drill in" | `Action::Activate` · `Enter` |
| **LOCKED PANE** | The TERMINAL PANE with `term_locked` set: every key is forwarded raw to the PTY except the ESCAPE HATCHES. Reached by ACTIVATE on a session, the forward PANEL WALK, a DOUBLE TAP, or ZOOM. The chip reads `INPUT`. | "locked terminal", "in the session", "typing at the agent", "input mode" | `app.rs::App::term_locked` · `event_loop/focus_walk.rs::enter_terminal_pane` |
| **CROSS WITHOUT LOCKING** | `Ctrl+→` (FOCUS TERMINAL): put FOCUS on the TERMINAL PANE without taking its input — the only unlocked way in. | "focus terminal", "ctrl right" | `Action::FocusTerminal` · `Ctrl+→` |
| **ESCAPE HATCH** | Any chord that leaves a LOCKED PANE: whatever `unlock_terminal` is bound to (default `Ctrl+Q`, `Ctrl+Shift+H`, `Ctrl+]`, `Ctrl+Esc`, `Ctrl+←`) plus the HARDWIRED UNLOCK. Also expands COLLAPSED sidebars. | "hatch", "get out of the terminal", "back to panels", "Ctrl+q: panels", "^q: panels" | `event_loop.rs::is_hatch` · `Action::UnlockTerminal` |
| **HARDWIRED UNLOCK** | `Ctrl+Q` always unlocks (and force-closes the VIM MODAL) no matter what is bound — so a rebind can never trap you in a session. | "ctrl q", "the final escape hatch" | `event_loop.rs::HARDWIRED_UNLOCK` · `Ctrl+Q` |
| **ZOOM** | `z`: collapse the sidebars (COLLAPSED) and lock input into the attached session — a full-screen terminal. An ESCAPE HATCH restores the layout. | "full screen", "zoom" | `Action::Zoom` · `app.rs::App::collapsed` · `z` |
| **KEYMAP** | The rebindable table of ACTION IDS → CHORDS, with defaults in code and overrides in CONFIG.JSON. Edited on the HOTKEYS TAB. | "keybindings", "hotkeys", "the keys" | `nebula-tui/src/keymap.rs::Keymap` · `"keybindings"` |
| **ACTION ID** | The snake_case name of a KEYMAP action (`focus_left`, `git_diff`, `select_workspace_3`) — the key in `"keybindings"`. Unknown ids are ignored, so stale overrides are harmless. | "action" | `keymap.rs::Action::id` |
| **CHORD** | A key spelling like `ctrl+shift+f`, `shift+tab`, `cmd+1`, `/`; comma-separated per ACTION ID. | "chord", "shortcut", "hotkey" | `keymap.rs::KeyChord::parse` |
| **KEY SCOPE** | Which mode a binding is live in: `Global` (panels) or `Terminal` (the LOCKED PANE — only `unlock_terminal` lives there). Conflicts only count within a scope. | "scope" | `keymap.rs::Scope` |
| **HOST REACH WARNING** | The HOTKEYS TAB's bind-time note that the host terminal will probably eat a CHORD: any `⌘`, `^⇧` without the KITTY PROTOCOL, `^←` on stock macOS. | "won't survive the trip", "command + p pastes the pi character", "cmd never reaches the pty" | `keymap.rs::host_warning` |
| **KITTY PROTOCOL** | The kitty keyboard protocol (`CSI … u`) that lets `Ctrl+Shift+…` chords reach nebula at all — Ghostty speaks it, Terminal.app does not. The KITTY SCANNER answers the child's queries. | "kitty", "csi u" | `nebula-daemon/src/pty/kitty.rs::KittyScanner` |
| **HOTKEY CAPTURE** | Pressing a new CHORD on a HOTKEYS TAB row; a duplicate shows `already X — Enter to move it here`. | "rebind" | `app.rs::HotkeyCapture` · `event_loop.rs::bind_hotkey` |
| **LINE EDITOR** | Every typed field (prompt, filter, query) is the same editor: `←→`/`⌥←→`, `Ctrl+a`/`Ctrl+e`, `⌥⌫`, `Ctrl+u`/`Ctrl+k`. | "the input", "the text field" | `nebula-tui/src/text_input.rs` |
| **NEW** | `n`: new PROJECT / WORKTREE / SESSION depending on FOCUS (opens the NEW SESSION PICKER in Sessions; on a PROJECT OPEN PRS GROUP row, a PR-scoped Claude AGENT). ADD PROJECT (`o`) adds a project from anywhere. | "n", "new" | `Action::New` · `n` / `Action::AddProject` · `o` |
| **RENAME** | `r`: rename the selected SESSION or edit a LINK's URL. A typed name clears AUTO-TITLE for good. | "rename", "r" | `Action::Rename` · `r` |
| **DELETE / DELETE ALL** | `d`: remove the selected row behind a CONFIRM DIALOG (worktrees take a typed confirm — files go). `Shift+D`: every row of the focused panel, casualties listed. | "delete", "remove" | `Action::Delete` / `DeleteAll` · `d` / `Shift+D` |
| **NEW TERMINAL** | `t`: a TERMINAL SESSION in the selected WORKTREE (repo root from the PROJECTS PANEL). | "open a shell", "terminal", "new terminal hotkey to t", "hotkey t" | `Action::NewTerminal` · `t` |
| **OPEN REPO** | `Shift+G`: open the repo's page on its git host (the `origin` remote turned into a browsable URL). | "open on github" | `Action::OpenRepo` · `nebula-tui/src/remote.rs` · `Shift+G` |
| **SELECT WORKSPACE N** | `1`–`9` (or `⌘1`–`⌘9` where delivered): open that WORKSPACE TAB without leaving the panel. Rebindable per slot. | "number keys", "cmd 1", "cmd + [1-9] to select the workspace" | `Action::SelectWorkspace(n)` · `1`–`9` |
| **TOGGLE WORKSPACES BAR** | `Shift+W`: show / hide the WORKSPACES BAR and save the choice as the `show_workspaces` SETTING (a hotkey that writes CONFIG.JSON — tests wrap it in `with_default_config`). | "capital W shift + w to toggle that entire panel", "hide the top bar" | `Action::ToggleWorkspaces` · `Config::show_workspaces` · `Shift+W` |
| **TOGGLE PROJECTS PANEL** | `Shift+P`: show / hide the PROJECTS PANEL on its own, saved as the `hide_projects` SETTING (also the `Projects panel` row on the SETTINGS OVERLAY's Appearance tab). The freed width goes to the TERMINAL PANE, the drag width is remembered, hiding the focused panel moves FOCUS right, and restoring never steals it; the FOOTER leads with `⇧P: show projects` while it is hidden. | "toggle the projects column", "hide the projects panel" | `keymap.rs::Action::ToggleProjects` · `Config::hide_projects` · `event_loop.rs::set_hide_projects` · `Shift+P` |
| **TOGGLE WORKTREES PANEL** | `Shift+B`: the same for the WORKTREES PANEL, saved as `hide_worktrees`; the SESSIONS PANEL can never be hidden. With both panels down the PANEL WALK runs WORKSPACES BAR → SESSIONS PANEL → TERMINAL PANE. | "toggle worktrees column separate", "hide the worktrees panel" | `keymap.rs::Action::ToggleWorktrees` · `Config::hide_worktrees` · `event_loop.rs::set_hide_worktrees` · `Shift+B` |
| **QUIT** | `q` / `Ctrl+C`: leave the TUI; SESSIONS keep running in the DAEMON. | "quit", "q" | `Action::Quit` · `q` |
| **DRAG SELECT** | Left-drag in the TERMINAL PANE selects and copies (double-click selects a word); Shift+drag falls through to the host terminal's own selection (mouse-capture bypass). Copy goes through the CLIPBOARD ROUTE. | "drag to copy", "select text" | `event_loop.rs::handle_mouse` (`TermSelection`) |
| **OPTION CLICK** | `⌥`-click a URL to open it in the browser, or a `file:line` to open it in the VIM MODAL. | "alt click", "option click" | `event_loop.rs::handle_mouse` · `nebula-tui/src/links.rs` |
| **SPLITTER DRAG** | Dragging a visible panel border (or the DIFF VIEWER's file list) resizes it. A hidden sidebar owns no splitter and keeps its last width for restoration. | "resize the panel", "dragging the panel to resize" | `app.rs::HitTarget::Splitter` · `App::splitter_indices` |
| **CLICK OUTSIDE** | A left-click outside any modal dismisses it, exactly as Esc would. | "click away" | `event_loop.rs::handle_mouse` |
| **WHEEL SCROLL** | Wheel over the TERMINAL PANE scrolls scrollback (forwarded as SGR reports when the child enabled mouse mode — Claude's alt-screen UI wants that); over Sessions it scrolls the list; over the PR PREVIEW, 3 lines a notch. | "scroll", "mouse wheel", "scroll on my mouse wheel", "Scroll wheel is sending arrow keys" | `event_loop.rs::SESSIONS_WHEEL_STEP`, `PR_PREVIEW_WHEEL_STEP` |
| **MOUSE MODE** | The child's own mouse reporting mode; when it is not `None`, nebula forwards mouse events to the PTY instead of handling them. | "mouse forwarding" | `event_loop.rs::handle_mouse` |

## 6. Overlays and views

| TERM | What it is | Also called | Where · key |
|---|---|---|---|
| **OVERLAY** | Any modal drawn over the panels: exactly one `app.overlay` at a time, so opening a CONFIRM DIALOG from a menu evicts the menu (which is why some confirms carry a "reopen" hint). | "modal", "popup", "dialog" | `app.rs::Overlay` |
| **CONTEXT MENU** | `m` / right-click: the row menu of MENU ACTIONS for whatever is selected — attach, restart, rename, archive, delete, **Attach cloud session**, **Send to cloud session**, workspace verbs. `→` opens the MODEL / EFFORT submenus. | "menu", "right click menu", "the m menu", "m menu" | `app.rs::Overlay::Menu`, `MenuAction` · `m` |
| **CONFIRM DIALOG** | A yes/no gate (`y`/`Enter` vs `Esc`/`n`) before a PENDING ACTION — delete, remove, reset settings, quit. Sized to its longest line (min 52 cols), no wrapping. | "confirmation", "are you sure" | `app.rs::Overlay::Confirm`, `PendingAction` |
| **PROMPT DIALOG** | A text prompt (`PromptKind`) for: add project, new worktree, new session name, rename, new link, and the multi-line CLOUD TASK EDITOR. | "prompt", "the name prompt" | `app.rs::Overlay::Prompt`, `PromptKind` |
| **NEW SESSION PICKER** | The menu `n` opens in the SESSIONS PANEL: Claude / Codex / Cursor, minus any AGENT KIND switched off on the SETTINGS OVERLAY's Agents tab (absent, not greyed; no Terminal row since 2026-08-28 — NEW TERMINAL is `t`); `→` drills into MODEL and EFFORT; `Tab` on Claude toggles CLOUD LAUNCH. | "session picker", "new session menu", "the agent picker", "new session harness selection modal", "modal that let's me pick codex or claude", "new session modal", "harness picker modal" | `app.rs::MenuAction::NewAgentOfKind` · `n` |
| **CLOUD TASK EDITOR** | The wrapped multi-line editor (`Shift+Enter` / `Ctrl+J` newline) for a CLOUD LAUNCH task, a CLOUD MESSAGE, or the task an agent preset launch wraps in its prefix and postfix. | "cloud prompt", "the task box", "dialog prompt so a user can type their prompt", "word wraps" | `app.rs::PromptKind::ClaudeCloudTask` / `CloudMessage` |
| **ADD PROJECT BROWSER** | The `n`/`o` add-project prompt with bash-style Tab completion and arrow-key directory browsing; `●` marks git repos. | "add project", "the path picker" | `app.rs::PromptKind::AddProject` · `n` / `o` |
| **HELP OVERLAY** | `?`: the two-column key cheat sheet built from the live KEYMAP. Descriptions clip at ~30 chars a side. | "help", "the key list" | `app.rs::Overlay::Help` · `?` |
| **SETTINGS OVERLAY** | `s`: tabs General / Sessions / Appearance / Agents / Hotkeys over CONFIG.JSON (Agents also holds the per-AGENT KIND `enabled` toggles that hide a harness from the NEW SESSION PICKER and the PR SESSION launch; the last one on cannot be switched off); `R` resets everything after a CONFIRM DIALOG. Reopening within a minute lands back on the row you left. | "settings", "the settings modal", "preferences", "settings modal", "the settings", "reset to default" | `app.rs::Overlay::Settings`, `SettingsView` · `config.rs::SETTINGS_TABS` · `s` |
| **HOTKEYS TAB** | The SETTINGS OVERLAY tab that lists every ACTION ID, what it answers to, and rebinds it (HOTKEY CAPTURE, HOST REACH WARNING). | "hotkeys", "keybindings tab", "customize ANY HOTKEY" | `config.rs::SETTINGS_TABS` |
| **AGENTS TAB** | The SETTINGS OVERLAY tab holding, per AGENT KIND, the `enabled` toggle and the MODEL / EFFORT defaults (Claude and Codex get model/effort rows, Cursor only the toggle). Switching a harness off hides it from the NEW SESSION PICKER and the PR SESSION launch; the last one on is refused with a warning. | "agents tab" | `nebula-tui/src/config.rs::SETTINGS_TABS` ("Agents") · `Config::enabled_kinds` |
| **DIFF VIEWER** | `g`: full-screen git diff for the selected WORKTREE — filtered file list left, diff right; on an OPEN PRS row, that PR's diff via `gh pr diff`. `Ctrl+r` sets a REVIEWED MARK. | "git diff", "diff view", "the diff", "view the git diff of that PR directly in nebula" | `app.rs::Overlay::Diff` · `nebula-tui/src/git_diff.rs` · `g` |
| **REVIEWED MARK** | The ✓ that sinks a file to the bottom of the DIFF VIEWER — nebula-side only, scoped to worktree + HEAD, cleared when the file changes again. Stored in REVIEWED.JSON. | "reviewed", "the tick", "mark as read" | `nebula-tui/src/review.rs` · `Ctrl+r` |
| **PALETTE** | `/`: the ` Jump to ` fuzzy search across every WORKSPACE, PROJECT, WORKTREE, SESSION and open PR, in *every* workspace (`workspace/project/branch/session` paths). `Ctrl+o` opens, `Ctrl+f` only lands the selection; picking a hit elsewhere switches workspace on the way. | "fuzzy jump", "slash search", "jump to", "the search", "/ fuzzy finder", "the / fuzzy find" | `app.rs::Overlay::Palette` · `nebula-tui/src/fuzzy.rs` · `/` |
| **FUZZY MATCH** | The matcher behind the PALETTE, FILE FINDER, DIFF VIEWER and TREE BROWSER filters: whitespace splits the query into AND-ed terms (fzf extended search), e.g. `neb #10`. | "more fuzzy", "fuzzy" | `nebula-tui/src/fuzzy.rs::fuzzy_match` |
| **FILE FINDER** | `f`: fuzzy file picker over the WORKTREE; `Enter` opens the VIM MODAL, `Ctrl+y` copies the path. | "find file", "file search", "fuzzy file finder" | `app.rs::Overlay::Files`, `FileFinder` · `f` |
| **GREP VIEW** | `Shift+F`: `git grep` across the WORKTREE; `Enter` opens the hit at its line. | "find in files", "grep", "find in files search" | `app.rs::Overlay::Grep` · `nebula-tui/src/grep_search.rs` · `Shift+F` |
| **TREE BROWSER** | `b`: file tree with a syntax-highlighted preview and a live filter; `Ctrl+y` copies the path. | "file tree", "file browser", "tree view", "full tree browser modal", "file preview" | `app.rs::Overlay::Tree` · `nebula-tui/src/tree_browser.rs` · `b` |
| **VIM MODAL** | An in-process PTY running the configured EDITOR over every overlay (from FILE FINDER, GREP VIEW, TREE BROWSER, OPTION CLICK). HARDWIRED UNLOCK force-closes it. | "editor modal", "the editor", "open in vim", "vim terminal", "a modal inside this app", "file viewer (vim)", "neovim" | `nebula-tui/src/vim_term.rs` · `ui.rs::draw_vim` |
| **MEMORY MODAL** | `Shift+M`: the ` Memory ` table (SESSION / WHERE / PID / PROCS / MEM) from the METRICS SNAPSHOT, re-polled every 2 s, with WARM SPARES under their own `warm spares (N)` tree. `Enter` opens the selected session. | "memory usage", "metrics", "the memory thing", "unknown agents", "metrics modal" | `app.rs::Overlay::Metrics` · `Shift+M` |
| **HOSTS PICKER** | `Shift+H`: the ` SSH Hosts ` list from the SSH HOSTS FILE; `Enter` reconnects (HOSTS HANDOFF), `a` adds `user@host [dir]`, `d` forgets. | "ssh hosts", "the h picker", "hosts", "press h to view all the hosts" | `app.rs::Overlay::Hosts` · `nebula-tui/src/hosts.rs` · `Shift+H` |
| **WORKSPACE SWITCHER** | `w` (or the NAMEPLATE): the workspace menu — `Enter` opens, `n`/`r`/`d` create / rename / delete (a created workspace opens at once with focus on the PROJECTS PANEL; delete asks first, refuses a non-empty workspace, and when the OPEN WORKSPACE goes lands on the WORKSPACE TAB to its right — from the last tab, the one to its left). The WORKSPACES BAR's `n`/`r`/`d` and its CONTEXT MENU are the same three verbs. | "workspace picker", "the w menu", "switcher", "w switcher", "workspace select modal", "workspace panel", "makes a new workspace" | `app.rs::MenuAction::OpenWorkspace` … · `w` |
| **SELECTION MEMORY** | The TUI remembers the last WORKTREE per PROJECT, the last SESSION per WORKTREE, and (since 2026-08-26) the last PROJECT per WORKSPACE, and restores them project-first on a switch and from the UI STATE BLOB at startup. | "remember the last selection", "remember the last agent that was selected", "auto remember my last select pref", "remember the last project, worktree, session selection" | `event_loop.rs::remember_context` / `restore_context` / `restore_workspace_project` · `app.rs::last_project_for_workspace` |
| **PENDING ACTION** | What a CONFIRM DIALOG commits on `y`: `DeleteAgent`, `DeleteWorktree`, `RemoveWorkspace{reopen_picker}`, `ResetSettings`, `Quit`, … | — | `app.rs::PendingAction` |
| **PENDING INTENT** | What to do when a request's Ack/Error comes back: attach the created session, select the created row, reopen the prompt on error, roll back a worktree delete. | — | `app.rs::PendingIntent` |
| **SELECT-WHEN-SEEN** | Stash an id and select its row once the DAEMON's upsert arrives — how a just-created PROJECT / WORKTREE / re-homed AGENT gets the cursor. e2e helpers must hop FOCUS back after such an auto-focus. | "auto focus it after creating" | `app.rs::select_project_when_seen`, `select_worktree_when_seen` |
| **MENU ACTION** | One row of a CONTEXT MENU. | — | `app.rs::MenuAction` |
| **HIT TARGET** | The mouse hit-test map (workspace, project, worktree, session, panel background, TERMINAL PANE, SPLITTER). | "clickable zone" | `app.rs::HitTarget` |

## 7. Agents and hooks

| TERM | What it is | Also called | Where · key |
|---|---|---|---|
| **AGENT KIND** | Which CLI an AGENT runs: `claude`, `codex`, `cursor` (`cursor-agent`). | "harness", "agent type", "claude / codex / cursor" | `nebula-core/src/entities.rs::AgentKind` |
| **MODEL / EFFORT** | The per-kind default `--model` and reasoning effort for new sessions (Claude: `--effort`; Codex: `-c model_reasoning_effort=`), set in the SETTINGS OVERLAY's Agents tab or per launch in the NEW SESSION PICKER submenus. | "model", "reasoning effort", "opus / sonnet" | `nebula-tui/src/config.rs::CLAUDE_MODELS`, `CODEX_EFFORTS` … |
| **RESUME** | Restoring an AGENT with its stored CLI session id: `claude --resume`, `codex resume`, `cursor-agent --resume`; falls back to a fresh session when the id is gone. Done by ENSURE SESSION on attach. | "resume", "restore the session" | `registry.rs::agent_spawn_command_with` |
| **ENSURE SESSION** | Lazily (re)spawn a dead SESSION's PTY on ATTACH — how a reaped or archived agent revives. | "revive", "respawn" | `registry.rs::ensure_session` |
| **RESTART AGENT** | The CONTEXT MENU's restart: kill and RESUME; a CLOUD SESSION row with no local id routes to CLOUD ATTACH instead. | "restart" | `registry.rs::restart_agent` |
| **HOOK RECEIVER** | The DAEMON's loopback HTTP server (`127.0.0.1:<random>`, per-boot BEARER TOKEN) that the agents' hook commands `curl`. Unversioned and fail-soft — a PROTOCOL VERSION bump can never break it. | "hook server", "the hooks endpoint", "phone home to nebula" | `nebula-daemon/src/hooks/mod.rs::start_hook_server` |
| **BEARER TOKEN** | The per-boot secret (`NEBULA_API_TOKEN`) injected only into AGENT ENV, checked by the HOOK RECEIVER. | "api token" | `hooks/mod.rs::HookEnv` |
| **HOOK ROUTE** | `POST /api/hooks/{claude,codex,cursor}?agentId=…&hookEvent=…`. Claude and Codex hit the *injectable* route (the response body can carry context); Cursor hits the plain one. | "hook route", "/api/hooks" | `hooks/mod.rs::receive_injectable_hook` / `receive_plain_hook` |
| **HOOK EVENT** | The parsed event: `UserPromptSubmit`, `Stop`, `SessionStart`, `PermissionRequest`, `Notification{idle_prompt…}`, `PreToolUse`, `PostToolUse`, `SubagentStart`, `SubagentStop`, plus synthetic `SessionEnded` and `Progress`. | "hook", "the stop hook" | `nebula-daemon/src/status.rs::HookEvent` |
| **MANAGED HOOKS** | The hook groups nebula writes at every spawn, tagged `_nebulaManaged`, user hooks preserved: `<worktree>/.claude/settings.local.json`, `~/.codex/hooks.json`, `<worktree>/.cursor/hooks.json`. | "managed hooks", "the hooks nebula installs" | `hooks/installer.rs::install_*_hooks` |
| **ENV GUARD** | Every hook command exits 0 when `NEBULA_AGENT_ID` / `NEBULA_API_URL` are unset, so the files are inert outside nebula. | — | `hooks/installer.rs::hook_command` |
| **CLAUDE HOOK DIALECT** | PascalCase events in `.claude/settings.local.json`, plus `permissions.allow` rules for `Bash(nebula rename:*)`, `Bash(nebula worktree:*)` and `Bash(nebula spawn:*)`. Only `UserPromptSubmit`'s command keeps stdout, so injected context reaches the model. | "claude hooks" | `hooks/installer.rs::CLAUDE_EVENTS`, `CLAUDE_ALLOW_RULES` |
| **CODEX HOOK DIALECT** | Claude-shaped hooks installed once in `$CODEX_HOME/hooks.json` — codex approves hooks per *file path*, so a per-worktree file would re-prompt forever. Injection only via the `hookSpecificOutput` envelope. | "codex hooks", "hooks need review" | `hooks/installer.rs::install_codex_hooks` |
| **CURSOR HOOK DIALECT** | camelCase events (`beforeSubmitPrompt`, `stop`, `subagentStart`…) in `.cursor/hooks.json` `version: 1`; each prints `{"continue":true}`; no permission hook, so cursor never reaches NEEDS FEEDBACK. Fires only in interactive mode. | "cursor hooks", "cursor doesn't seem to update the status" | `hooks/installer.rs::CURSOR_EVENTS` |
| **AUTO-TITLE** | A session left on its default name (`agent-N`) gets the AUTO-TITLE INSTRUCTION injected on its first `UserPromptSubmit`; the agent runs `nebula rename <3-4 words>` once; the daemon applies it only while `auto_title_pending` is set, so a user RENAME always wins. | "auto title", "auto name", "name themselves", "the title hook", "automatically rename the session", "title between 3-4 words", "still just named agent-1 agent-2" | `hooks/mod.rs::auto_title_injection` · `registry.rs::auto_rename_agent` |
| **AUTO-TITLE INSTRUCTION** | The model-facing text telling the agent to run a bare `nebula rename <Title>` — bare on purpose: an absolute path would stop matching the allow rule, but it means PATH's `nebula` answers (see VERSION SKEW). | "the rename instruction" | `hooks/mod.rs::AUTO_TITLE_INSTRUCTION` |
| **CURSOR TITLE RULE** | Cursor can't take injected context, so it gets a managed `.cursor/rules/nebula-title.mdc` carrying the AUTO-TITLE INSTRUCTION. | — | `hooks/installer.rs::install_cursor_title_rule` |
| **WORKTREE GUIDANCE** | The `--append-system-prompt` every Claude launch gets: run `nebula worktree <name>` instead of `EnterWorktree` when asked for a worktree. Since 2026-08-28 the same appended prompt also carries the `nebula spawn` rule (see the Candidates ledger), joined after it. | "the worktree instruction", "skill + system prompt or something" | `registry.rs::CLAUDE_WORKTREE_GUIDANCE` · `sibling.rs::CLAUDE_SPAWN_GUIDANCE` |
| **WORKTREE RELOCATION** | `nebula worktree` re-homes the SESSION's row under the (new or existing) WORKTREE at once, then — when the turn ends — respawns the CLI resumed (RESUME) inside it with a RELOCATION PROMPT. The restart is the only way: a CLI can't `cd` out of where it started. | "move into a worktree", "do this in a worktree", "relocate", "pending move", "move the session out of that main worktree root" | `registry.rs::enter_worktree`, `complete_pending_move` · `nebula worktree` |
| **RELOCATION PROMPT** | The note the relocated session opens with, saying where it now runs. | — | `registry.rs::relocation_prompt` |
| **STARTING PROMPT** | The request-only `CreateAgent { starting_prompt }` the DAEMON hands the CLI as its trailing positional argument on a cold spawn — never persisted, so RESUME cannot replay it, and it skips PREWARM POOL adoption. What an agent preset launch composes and what `nebula spawn` passes; the RELOCATION PROMPT rides the same argv slot. | "starting prompt", "first prompt", "using the prompt the user made" | `protocol.rs::ClientRequest::CreateAgent::starting_prompt` · `registry.rs::validate_starting_prompt` |
| **CWD REPARENT** | A hook payload whose cwd is inside another WORKTREE of the same PROJECT re-homes the row there (a `cd`, an `EnterWorktree`). A cd outside the workspace root is reset. | "re-home", "reparent", "move the session to that worktree", "automatically move" | `registry.rs::reparent_agent_by_cwd` |
| **CLI PROBE** | Boot-time `command -v` per AGENT KIND through the login shell, cached (1 h ok / 60 s fail); skipped under `NEBULA_AGENT_CMD`. | — | `registry.rs::warm_cli_probes` |
| **LOGIN SHELL WRAP** | Agents are spawned through `$SHELL -l -i -c`, so the user's rc files (and their PATH prepends) apply. | "new sessions don't use my ~/.zshrc" | `registry.rs::login_shell_wrap` |

## 8. Daemon mechanisms

| TERM | What it is | Also called | Where · key |
|---|---|---|---|
| **PREWARM POOL** | The DAEMON pre-boots one real agent CLI per (WORKTREE, AGENT KIND, MODEL, EFFORT) while you rest on a worktree, and the next `CreateAgent` adopts it so attaching lands on a booted screen. Spares live up to 15 min (`PREWARM_MAX_AGE`) — 150–300 MB each. Opt-out: `"prewarm_agents": false`. | "warm spares", "unknown agents", "prewarmed", "sub agents (mistaken)", "prefetch these connections" | `registry.rs::prewarm_agent`, `PrewarmEntry` · `"prewarm_agents"` |
| **WARM SPARE** | One pre-booted CLI in the PREWARM POOL: a real process with a fresh `NEBULA_AGENT_ID` and no store row, hence `warm`, not an agent, in the MEMORY MODAL and FOOTER. | "spare", "warm" | `protocol.rs::PrewarmInfo` |
| **PREWARM DEBOUNCE** | The 250 ms rest on a sidebar row before the TUI asks for a prewarm; keep-warm refreshes every 4 min. | — | `event_loop.rs::PREWARM_DEBOUNCE`, `KEEPWARM_REFRESH` |
| **SESSION PREWARM** | Pre-booting a WORKTREE's dead SESSIONS while the selection rests on it. Opt-out `"prewarm_sessions": false`. | "pre-boot dead sessions" | `registry.rs::prewarm_worktree_sessions` · `"prewarm_sessions"` |
| **IDLE REAPER** | Every 15 s, kill PTYs in WORKTREES no client is viewing once they pass the IDLE TIMEOUT; spares RUNNING and NEEDS FEEDBACK agents and terminals with a command running (the PIN exemption retired with PIN). A reaped agent RESUMES on the next ATTACH. | "the reaper", "idle timeout kills", "auto suspend or kill claude sessions that are not in focus", "reap process" | `registry.rs::reap_idle_sessions` · `NEBULA_IDLE_REAP_MS` |
| **IDLE TIMEOUT** | The `session_idle_timeout` setting (`off`/`1m`/`5m`/`15m`/`30m`/`1h`, default 5m) the IDLE REAPER uses. | "idle timeout" | `config.rs::SESSION_IDLE_TIMEOUTS` |
| **WORKTREE SYNC** | Every 2 s the DAEMON mtime-probes each repo and reconciles `git worktree list`, so worktrees made outside nebula appear and removed ones drop. | "git poll", "external worktrees", "directory watcher on .worktrees" | `registry.rs::sync_project_worktrees` · `NEBULA_WORKTREE_SYNC_MS` |
| **GIT POLL** | The TUI-side tick that looks up the PR ROW (`gh pr view`) per worktree and the PROJECT OPEN PRS GROUP (`gh pr list`) per project, every 15 s (`PR_REFRESH`, `OPEN_PRS_REFRESH`) — one GraphQL point each against GitHub's 5,000/hour. | "the gh poll", "pr refresh", "refresh rate for the pull requests" | `nebula-tui/src/pull_request.rs` · `event_loop.rs::OPEN_PRS_REFRESH` |
| **BOOT SWEEP** | On daemon start, agents persisted as live are marked DISCONNECTED. | — | `store.rs::sweep_disconnected` |
| **KITTY SCANNER** | Answers the child's KITTY PROTOCOL queries off the PTY stream and reports its flag stack to clients (`KittyFlags`). | — | `pty/kitty.rs::KittyScanner` |
| **CLOUD SCANNER** | Reads the `session_…` id and the attach refusal off a `claude --cloud` child's output; replays the ring first so arming after spawn cannot miss it. | — | `pty/cloud.rs::CloudScanner` |

## 9. Cloud sessions

| TERM | What it is | Also called | Where · key |
|---|---|---|---|
| **CLOUD SESSION** | An AGENT row whose work runs in Claude's cloud: created by CLOUD LAUNCH, carrying `cloud_session_id`, badged CLOUD BADGE, re-entered by CLOUD ATTACH / CLOUD TELEPORT, followed by the CLOUD MIRROR. | "claude cloud session", "cloud row", "cloud mode" | `entities.rs::Agent::cloud_session_id` |
| **CLOUD LAUNCH** | `claude --cloud=<task>` from the NEW SESSION PICKER (`Tab` on Claude, then the CLOUD TASK EDITOR). The CLI prints the session URL and exits; nebula reads the id and re-enters on its own. Don't put secrets in the task — it is a process argument. | "create a cloud session", "cloud task", "claude cloud", "--cloud argument" | `registry.rs::CloudLaunch::Create` |
| **CLOUD ATTACH** | Re-enter a CLOUD SESSION live with `claude --cloud=<id>`. Gated off for most accounts (`not enabled for your account`); once this daemon has seen the refusal (ATTACH GATE) it goes straight to CLOUD TELEPORT. Menu: **Attach cloud session**. | "attach to the cloud session", "attach claude" | `registry.rs::attach_cloud_agent`, `cloud_reentry_launch` · `ClientRequest::AttachCloudAgent` |
| **ATTACH GATE** | The daemon-wide flag set when live attach is refused, so later re-entries skip the red error. Probe the real CLI under a PTY (`script -q`) — without a TTY it fails differently. | "the gate" | `registry.rs::Daemon::cloud_attach_gated` |
| **CLOUD TELEPORT** | `claude --teleport=<id>`: a repeatable snapshot pull of the cloud transcript and branch into a local session — a fork, not a live link. Always in a `cloud-<id8>` CLOUD WORKTREE, never the ROOT WORKTREE (the CLI switches branches). | "teleport" | `registry.rs::CloudLaunch::Teleport`, `cloud_worktree_for` |
| **CLOUD WORKTREE** | The `cloud-<last 8 of id>` worktree a CLOUD SESSION in the main checkout is re-homed into before attach/teleport. | "cloud worktree" | `registry.rs::cloud_worktree_branch` |
| **CLOUD MIRROR** | Re-teleport every 45 s so the pane follows the cloud agent; shows `cloud ↻`. Ends on the first keystroke into the pane (the session is yours from then on) and when its pane is gone. `NEBULA_CLOUD_MIRROR_SECS` sets the cadence, `0` disables. | "mirror", "follow the cloud session", "cloud session output show up" | `registry.rs::CLOUD_MIRROR_REFRESH`, `refresh_cloud_mirror` · `NEBULA_CLOUD_MIRROR_SECS` |
| **CLOUD MESSAGE** | **Send to cloud session**: `claude -p <msg> --cloud=<id>` via the CLOUD TASK EDITOR, then a fresh pull. The CLI only prints `Sent to cloud session.` — the reply arrives on a later CLOUD MIRROR tick. | "send a message to the cloud session" | `registry.rs::send_cloud_message` · `ClientRequest::SendCloudMessage` |

## 10. CLI commands

| TERM | What it is | Also called | Where · key |
|---|---|---|---|
| **NEBULA** | Bare `nebula`: launch the TUI, auto-starting the DAEMON. `--workspace <name>` scopes the instance. `nebula <dir>` / `nebula .` is NEBULA ADD. | "launch nebula" | `crates/nebula/src/main.rs::Cli` |
| **NEBULA ADD** | Register a checkout as a PROJECT, named after its root dir, under the OPEN WORKSPACE. | "add a repo", "add project" | `nebula add [path]` |
| **NEBULA DAEMON** | Run the DAEMON; `--foreground` keeps it attached with logs to stderr. Dozens of stray foreground daemons starve the e2e suites. | — | `nebula daemon [--foreground]` |
| **NEBULA KILL** | Stop the DAEMON and every SESSION cleanly (SIGTERM fallback on VERSION SKEW). The cutover step after MAKE INSTALL when the *daemon* is the old side. | "kill the daemon", "kill-server" | `nebula kill` |
| **NEBULA RENAME** | Title the current SESSION from inside it — what AUTO-TITLE runs. `--force` retitles a named one; a late attempt is "already titled". | "rename", "the rename hook" | `nebula rename <title> [--force]` · `ipc.rs::run_rename` |
| **NEBULA WORKTREE** | Move the current SESSION into a WORKTREE of its PROJECT (WORKTREE RELOCATION); no name invents one, `--base <ref>` picks a new branch's start. | "nebula worktree", "do this in a worktree" | `nebula worktree [name] [--base ref]` · `ipc.rs::run_worktree` |
| **NEBULA SPAWN** | `nebula spawn "<task>" [--kind claude\|codex\|cursor]`, run by an AGENT from inside its own SESSION when the user says "start a new nebula session that …": the DAEMON starts a second AGENT beside the caller — same WORKTREE, same AGENT KIND and MODEL / EFFORT unless `--kind` names another — on the task as its STARTING PROMPT, named `agent-N` so AUTO-TITLE applies, landing in the SESSIONS PANEL without moving FOCUS; the caller is untouched. Claude learns it from `CLAUDE_SPAWN_GUIDANCE`, appended after the WORKTREE GUIDANCE. | "start a new nebula session", "run a new session automatically", "spin up another session" | `nebula-daemon/src/sibling.rs::spawn_sibling_agent` · `protocol.rs::ClientRequest::SpawnSiblingAgent` · `ipc.rs::spawn_sibling_for_current_agent` · `nebula spawn` |
| **NEBULA WORKSPACE** | `add` / `open` / `list` / `rename` / `delete` WORKSPACES from the shell; `open` sets what the next instance launches into. | — | `nebula workspace <sub>` |
| **NEBULA SSH** | `ssh -t <host> '… exec nebula'`: run nebula *on* a remote box over this terminal, self-installing it there if missing; records the destination in the SSH HOSTS FILE. The whole TUI — copy included — runs remotely. | "nebula ssh", "ssh into the ubuntu machine" | `crates/nebula/src/ssh.rs::run_ssh` · `nebula ssh <host> [dir]` |
| **NEBULA TUNNEL** | One `ssh -tt -L` whose remote command runs `nebula browser --no-open` on the remote's loopback; the local URL opens once bytes come back. Nothing is exposed on the remote network. Needs ttyd there. If a ttyd already answers on the remote port (`server: ttyd` header) the remote script reuses it and holds the session open on a long sleep instead of starting a second NEBULA BROWSER (`reuse_existing_ttyd!`). Authentication is ssh's own — nebula adds no password of its own and passes no `--credential`; a password prompt means the remote refused your key. | "tunnel", "ssh tunnel", "run ssh tunnel", "port is already in use" | `crates/nebula/src/tunnel.rs::run_tunnel` · `nebula tunnel <host> [dir] [--port N] [--remote-port N]` |
| **NEBULA BROWSER** | Serve this TUI in a browser tab via ttyd (`--port`, `--bind`, `--public`, `--credential USER:PASSWORD`, `--no-open`). Loopback and unauthenticated by default — a live writable terminal, so widen it deliberately. | "browser mode", "ttyd", "run on loopback or public" | `crates/nebula/src/browser.rs::run_browser` · `nebula browser` |
| **NEBULA UPGRADE** | Run INSTALL.SH over this binary; refuses a local cargo build without `--force`; a running daemon keeps its old binary until NEBULA KILL. | "upgrade", "update nebula" | `crates/nebula/src/upgrade.rs` · `nebula upgrade [--force]` |
| **RAW ATTACH** | Hidden debug client: raw passthrough to a session, `Ctrl+\` detaches. | — | `nebula _raw-attach [name]` |
| **STALE DAEMON NOTE** | Hidden installer hook printing the cutover note when the live daemon's BUILDSTAMP differs from this binary — what MAKE INSTALL prints. | "the cutover note" | `nebula _stale-daemon-note` · `lifecycle.rs::daemon_is_stale` |
| **HOSTS HANDOFF** | Picking a host in the HOSTS PICKER quits the TUI cleanly and re-execs `nebula ssh` over the same terminal; local SESSIONS keep running. | "reconnect" | `main.rs` (`run_tui` → `ssh::run_ssh`) |
| **SSH HOSTS FILE** | `ssh_hosts.json` in the DATA DIR: every NEBULA SSH / NEBULA TUNNEL destination, newest first, capped at 20. | "saved hosts" | `nebula-tui/src/hosts.rs` |
| **CLIPBOARD ROUTE** | How a copy (DRAG SELECT, `Ctrl+y`) reaches the clipboard: local → `pbcopy`/`wl-copy`/`xclip`; remote (`SSH_CONNECTION` set) → an OSC 52 escape written through the terminal (`copied N chars (via terminal)`). Terminal.app drops OSC 52; Ghostty and iTerm2 honour it. | "copy failed (clipboard unavailable)", "copy text after nebula ssh" | `event_loop.rs::copy_and_flash`, `App::pending_clipboard` |

## 11. Config and environment

| TERM | What it is | Also called | Where · key |
|---|---|---|---|
| **CONFIG.JSON** | The one settings file in the DATA DIR, read fresh on every use by both DAEMON and TUI (hand edits apply live); what the SETTINGS OVERLAY writes. | "config", "settings file", "config.json" | `nebula-tui/src/config.rs::Config` · `nebula-daemon/src/config.rs::Config` |
| **SETTING** | One CONFIG.JSON key: `theme`, `animations`, `focus_tint`, `show_workspaces` (the WORKSPACES BAR), `hide_projects` (the PROJECTS PANEL), `hide_worktrees` (the WORKTREES PANEL), `editor`, `claude_model`/`claude_effort`, `codex_model`/`codex_effort`, `claude_enabled`/`codex_enabled`/`cursor_enabled`, `session_idle_timeout`, `done_sound`, `skip_session_naming`, `palette_enter_attaches`, `git_init_on_create`, `keybindings`; daemon-only `prewarm_agents`, `prewarm_sessions`. | "setting", "option" | `config.rs::Config` |
| **EDITOR** | The editor the VIM MODAL runs (`vim` default; `nvim`, `nano`, `emacs`, `hx`); `NEBULA_EDITOR` overrides. | "editor" | `config.rs::Config::editor` · `NEBULA_EDITOR` |
| **REVIEWED.JSON** | The REVIEWED MARK store beside CONFIG.JSON. | — | `nebula-tui/src/review.rs` |
| **NEBULA_RUNTIME_DIR / NEBULA_DATA_DIR** | Isolate an instance: override the RUNTIME DIR and DATA DIR (tests, MAKE DEV, the DEV INSTANCE). Inherited down make → TUI → daemon → agent PTY; nothing propagates *which binary*. | "isolation env" | `paths.rs` |
| **NEBULA_AGENT_CMD** | Replace every agent CLI command (e.g. `/bin/cat` or a STUB AGENT script); skips the CLI PROBE. Spawns override the argv verbatim, so a stub can't tell attach from teleport. | "stub agent", "AGENT=" | `registry.rs` |
| **NEBULA_LOG** | tracing filter for DAEMON LOG / `tui.log` (`debug`). | — | `main.rs::init_*_logging` |
| **NEBULA_CLOUD_MIRROR_SECS** | CLOUD MIRROR cadence (default 45, floor 2, `0` off). | — | `registry.rs::cloud_mirror_refresh` |
| **NEBULA_IDLE_REAP_MS / NEBULA_WORKTREE_SYNC_MS** | Test knobs for the IDLE REAPER sweep and WORKTREE SYNC probe periods. | — | `nebula-daemon/src/lib.rs` |
| **NEBULA_INSTALL_DIR / NEBULA_INSTALL_URL / NEBULA_UPGRADE_HANDOFF** | INSTALL.SH destination (`~/.local/bin`), an override script URL for NEBULA UPGRADE / NEBULA SSH (tests use `file://`), and the flag NEBULA UPGRADE sets so the script skips its daemon note. | — | `install.sh` · `upgrade.rs` |

## 12. Dev workflow and testing

| TERM | What it is | Also called | Where · key |
|---|---|---|---|
| **SHARED CHECKOUT** | This repo's main working tree, which several nebula sessions edit at once. Assume it is behind `origin/main` (releases are cut from a RELEASE WORKTREE; only a release asked to "pull latest" fast-forwards it — v0.15.0 did, earlier ones did not), and that compile errors or test-count drift may be another session's. Baseline `cargo check` before starting. | "shared tree", "the main checkout", "this", "the tree", "pull latest from main" | `git diff origin/main` (not HEAD) |
| **RELEASE WORKTREE** | The private `release-vX.Y.Z` worktree off `origin/main` the RELEASE SKILL builds in: the SHARED CHECKOUT's delta brought in as a plain `cp` when its HEAD *is* `origin/main` (`git rev-list --left-right --count HEAD...origin/main` = `0 0`), else as a `--3way` patch or a cherry-picked snapshot commit (a blind `cp` there reverts what origin merged), tests in an isolated `CARGO_TARGET_DIR`, three commits (feature / `.claude/MEMORY.md` / `Release vX.Y.Z`), pushed as `main`, tagged. | "release branch" | `.claude/skills/release/SKILL.md` |
| **SCRATCH WORKTREE** | A throwaway `git worktree add` in the session scratchpad, off whatever ref the job needs (a stash commit, `pull/N/head`), where a merge or a PR is resolved, built and tested with `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` outside the repo so the SHARED CHECKOUT's dirty tree is never touched. It registers in the repo's worktree list, so remove it when done or WORKTREE SYNC shows it as a row. The RELEASE WORKTREE is the release-shaped one. | "scratch", "scratch merge" | `git worktree add <scratchpad>/<name> <ref>` · MEMORY "Fixing A Fork PR's Conflicts From The Shared Tree, Then A Security Audit Of Its Diff" |
| **RELEASE SKILL** | `/release`: verify green, commit, bump `[workspace.package].version`, tag, push, replace the GitHub notes with a real changelog — a one-line opener, benefit-grouped `###` headers with one emoji each, fixes filed under the feature they keep, a `⚠️ Heads up` line for the PROTOCOL VERSION bump, the INSTALL.SH line last (the shape settled 2026-08-28). Triggered by "commit push release". | "commit push release", "commit push and release", "commit and push and release", "cut a release", "ship it", "do a release", "make another release" | `.claude/skills/release/SKILL.md` |
| **RELEASE WORKFLOW** | CI on a `v*` tag: darwin arm/intel + linux x64/arm64 (musl) tarballs attached to a GitHub release — what INSTALL.SH downloads. | "the release action", "CI" | `.github/workflows/release.yml` |
| **RELEASE NOTES** | The body of a GitHub release for a `vX.Y.Z` tag — the changelog the RELEASE SKILL writes over the RELEASE WORKFLOW's auto-generated commit list: a `**Nebula vX.Y.Z is out.**` opener, `###` benefit groups with one emoji each, bold-lead-in bullets with fixes filed under the feature they keep, a `⚠️ Heads up` line for the PROTOCOL VERSION bump / NEBULA KILL, the INSTALL.SH one-liner last. | "release description", "the changelog", "release notes" | `.claude/skills/release/SKILL.md` §7 · `gh release edit vX.Y.Z --notes-file` |
| **INSTALL.SH** | The curl-able installer: prebuilt tarball per target into `NEBULA_INSTALL_DIR`, `cargo install --git` fallback. Repo slug is `AgentSystemLabs/nebula`. | "the install script", "one command for anyone to install" | `install.sh` |
| **MAKE DEV** | Run this checkout's build as an isolated DEV INSTANCE (own daemon and data, seeded from the real DB; `SEED=0`, `AGENT=/bin/cat`). Its daemon spawns from `current_exe()`, so it is always this build — but a bare `nebula rename` from an agent still resolves on PATH (see VERSION SKEW). | "make dev", "dev instance", "run nebula without port conflicts as i run in various worktrees" | `Makefile::dev` · `make dev` |
| **DEV INSTANCE** | The per-checkout isolated nebula MAKE DEV runs: runtime `/tmp/nebula-dev-<8-char hash of $CURDIR>`, data `~/.nebula-dev/<name>-<hash>`. `make dev-ls` / `dev-stop` / `dev-reset` / `dev-seed` manage it. | "dev slot", "the dev daemon" | `Makefile::DEV_SLOT`, `DEV_RUNTIME`, `DEV_DATA` |
| **MAKE INSTALL** | Build release and copy it into `~/.cargo/bin/nebula` via cp + mv (a fresh inode — overwriting in place gets SIGKILLed by macOS), then print the STALE DAEMON NOTE. Follow with NEBULA KILL to cut the daemon over. | "make install", "install the build", "zsh: killed", "stale signature" | `Makefile::install` · `make install` |
| **MAKE CYCLE** | The re-runnable full cutover: MAKE INSTALL, then NEBULA KILL (stops the real daemon and every SESSION — run it from a terminal outside nebula), then MAKE DEV. Install goes first so a failed build kills nothing. | "kill & install & dev all in one", "keep re-running" | `Makefile::cycle` · `make cycle` |
| **MAKE BROWSER** | MAKE DEV served into a browser tab via ttyd (`PORT=` pins). | — | `Makefile::browser` |
| **MAKE CI** | `fmt-check` + `lint` (`STRICT=1` clippy) + `test`. | — | `Makefile::ci` |
| **E2E PTY** | The daemon end-to-end suite over the real IPC: CRUD, attach/scrollback, hooks, progress, CWD REPARENT, cloud chain, restart persistence. Flaky on a cold binary ("daemon socket never appeared") — rerun before debugging. | "e2e_pty", "the e2e tests" | `crates/nebula/tests/e2e_pty.rs` |
| **ORPHAN DAEMONS** | Stray `nebula daemon --foreground` processes left by killed test runs; dozens of them starve new test daemons (no `daemon.log` at all is the tell). Reap them with `ps -eo pid,command \| grep "[n]ebula daemon"` — never the live `/tmp/nebula-<uid>` daemon. | "orphan daemons", "stray daemons" | `crates/nebula/tests/e2e_pty.rs::DaemonProc` |
| **E2E TUI** | Runs the real `nebula` binary in a PTY, sends raw key bytes (`\x1b[Z` = Shift+Tab, `\x1b[108;6u` = kitty Ctrl+Shift+L), parses frames with vt100. "The walk stops here" is proved by pressing again and walking back. | "e2e_tui" | `crates/nebula/tests/e2e_tui.rs` |
| **TESTBACKEND** | ratatui's in-memory backend the `nebula-tui` unit tests render into and read back as text. It holds symbols and styles, not pixels — sub-cell gaps are invisible; double-width emoji read back with an extra space. | "buffer_text", "the render tests" | `event_loop.rs` / `ui.rs` `mod tests` |
| **STUB AGENT** | A script substituted for the agent CLI via `NEBULA_AGENT_CMD` in e2e tests and MAKE DEV — its first line can race the create's own upsert, so wait for the event, then poll the file. | "stub", "fake agent" | `crates/nebula/tests/e2e_pty.rs` |
| **SCREENSHOT HARNESS** | An isolated demo daemon + STUB AGENTS + tmux → PNG pipeline for design shots; a glyph question is settled faster with Pillow + Menlo. | "screenshot", "design shot" | `design-screenshots/` |
| **MEMORY LOG** | The shared work log, in three layers: `.claude/MEMORY.md` (the index — one line per task, newest first, capped at 200 lines), `.claude/memory/gotchas.md` (the standing gotchas, grouped by TERM, capped at 300), and `.claude/memory/entries/<date>-<slug>.md` (each task's full Asked / Did / Gotchas, fetched by the RECALL HOOK or opened by index line). Written by the NEBULA-MEMORY SKILL; `make memory-check` enforces the caps. | "memory.md", "the memory", "log this" | `.claude/MEMORY.md` · `.claude/memory/` · `make memory-check` |
| **NEBULA-MEMORY SKILL** | Appends or updates a MEMORY LOG entry at the end of a task. | "remember this", "write this to memory" | `.claude/skills/nebula-memory/SKILL.md` |
| **PROMPT DADDY** | The skill that rewrites every new prompt once, into its best fully specified version in TERMS, asks the user only for context the work cannot proceed without (who / what / when / where / why / how), logs the final prompt (`Refined prompt:` + a quote) and proceeds on it without asking whether it is right; the refined prompt is the request. | "prompt daddy", "prompt doctor", "improve my prompt" | `.claude/skills/prompt-daddy/SKILL.md` |
| **PROJECT TERMS** | This file, and the skill that keeps it true after every task: it detects the vocabulary each task surfaced, records aliases, renames and retirements at once, and promotes a new name to a TERM only after it recurs across separate tasks (the Candidates ledger, section 14). | "the glossary", "terms", "the defined terms" | `TERMS.md` · `.claude/skills/project-terms/SKILL.md` |
| **OUTPUT DOCTOR** | The skill every reply that answers or closes a request goes through last, after the NEBULA-MEMORY SKILL and PROJECT TERMS: it shapes the reply into four fixed sections — `==== YOU ASKED ====` (the PROMPT DADDY refined prompt, verbatim), `==== OVERVIEW ====` (what happened, plain sentences), `==== TECHNICAL OVERVIEW ====` (the details, kept short), `==== NEXT STEPS ====` (always last: what is left for the user — commit, PR, a question, a command, a decision, or "Nothing — this is done.") — plus `==== ACTION REQUIRED ====` between OVERVIEW and TECHNICAL OVERVIEW, present if and only if the user must do something before the work is complete (numbered steps, exact commands). | "output doctor", "format this", "use the output format", "action required" (the section) | `.claude/skills/output-doctor/SKILL.md` · `CLAUDE.md` § "Before you reply" |
| **REFINED PROMPT** | The one rewrite PROMPT DADDY produces from a new prompt — aliases swapped for TERMS, gaps closed, judgments marked "(assuming …)" — logged in the chat as `Refined prompt:` + a `>` quote, then worked from as the request; OUTPUT DOCTOR quotes it as `YOU ASKED` and the MEMORY LOG carries it on a `→ refined:` line. | "the final prompt", "refined prompt" | `.claude/skills/prompt-daddy/SKILL.md` § "5. Log it and go" |
| **RECALL HOOK** | The `UserPromptSubmit` hook that maps the prompt's words onto TERMS (via the Alias index) and file names, scores the MEMORY LOG index lines, and injects the best few entries' Gotchas plus the matching STANDING GOTCHAS as `[nebula recall] …` context. | "nebula recall", "the recall" | `.claude/hooks/recall.py` · `.claude/settings.json` |
| **GUARD HOOK** | The `PreToolUse` hook on Bash that blocks commands a recurring gotcha warned about (backticks in a double-quoted commit message, `cargo install --path`, an in-place `cp` over `~/.cargo/bin/nebula`) and feeds the right way back to the agent; heredoc bodies are stripped before matching. | "the guard" | `.claude/hooks/guard.py` |
| **STANDING GOTCHAS** | `.claude/memory/gotchas.md`: the MEMORY LOG's durable traps promoted out of entries, one line each grouped by TERM, with `re-hit ×N` and `retire:` markers; read in full by every session and capped at 300 lines. | "gotchas.md", "standing gotcha" | `.claude/memory/gotchas.md` |
| **MEMORY CHECK** | `make memory-check` (first step of MAKE CI): fails when the MEMORY LOG index or the STANDING GOTCHAS exceed their cap, an index line links to a missing entry, or an entry has no index line. | "memory-check" | `.claude/memory/check.py` · `Makefile::memory-check` |
| **SELF-IMPROVING LOOP** | The per-task cycle every AGENT in a nebula SESSION runs: read the MEMORY LOG and PROJECT TERMS → PROMPT DADDY → do the work → NEBULA-MEMORY SKILL → PROJECT TERMS → OUTPUT DOCTOR, so each task leaves the next one better grounded. Its two files are also where a long-lived branch re-conflicts with `main` on every merge. | "the self improving loop", "the self improving look", "our custom shared memory system", "the memory system" | `CLAUDE.md` § "Project memory and vocabulary" · `AGENTS.md` |
| **CRATES** | `nebula-core` (protocol, entities, ids, paths, codec), `nebula-daemon` (registry, PTYs, hooks, status, store), `nebula-tui` (app, event loop, ui, keymap, config, overlays, IPC client), `nebula` (the binary: CLI dispatch, browser/ssh/tunnel/upgrade). | "the crates" | `Cargo.toml` members |
| **KEEP MODULES SMALL** | The `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` rule: a long file, `impl`, struct or function is a refactoring smell — split what the task already touches into smaller modules, types or functions, behavior-preserving and tested first, no numeric line limit, no drive-by moves of files the task does not touch (the AGENT PRESETS overlays went to `preset_overlays.rs` under it). | "the claude and agents" (the file pair), "split up larger files", "too long of files is a refactoring smell" | `CLAUDE.md` § "Keep modules small" · `AGENTS.md` § "Keep modules small" |

## 13. Retired

Names that old prompts and MEMORY LOG entries still use. Do not bring them back without saying so.

| TERM | What it was | Retired |
|---|---|---|
| **NOTES** | Per-owner note lists (`e` key, `Overlay::Notes`, `notes` table, `note_badge`). Removed entirely at the user's choice; `e` stayed unbound until 2026-08-28, when the agent presets list took it. | 2026-08-26 |
| **MOVE PROJECT** | `Shift+J` / `Shift+K` (and `Shift+↑/↓`) reordering the selected PROJECT by hand (`Action::MoveProjectUp/Down`, `ClientRequest::MoveProject`, `Daemon::move_project`). Removed end to end; the PROJECTS PANEL follows the RECENCY ORDER instead, and the shifted keys are unbound in every panel. `Project.sort_order` stays as insertion order. | 2026-08-28 |
| **NEW LINK** | The `Shift+L` action and prompt that manually created a LINK. Removed from the TUI; existing LINK rows remain readable/editable and `Shift+L` is unbound. | 2026-08-28 |
| **PIN** | `p` / the CONTEXT MENU's Pin: pinned WORKTREES and SESSIONS sorted into a PINNED group on top of their panel and were spared by the IDLE REAPER (`Action::Pin`, `ClientRequest::SetAgentPinned` / `SetWorktreePinned`, `Agent.pinned` / `Worktree.pinned`). Removed end to end at the user's choice — RECENCY ORDER and the AGO BADGE made it redundant; `p` is unbound, the SQLite `pinned` columns stay unread. | 2026-08-28 |
| **RECENT WINDOW** | The `recent_window` SETTING (`off`/`5m`/…/`24h`, default 30m) that put freshly-stamped SESSIONS under a RECENT header above UNPINNED. Removed with PIN: the live agents are one header-less list in RECENCY ORDER. | 2026-08-28 |
| **NEW BADGE** | The DONE BADGE's earlier wording ` n new` in green `ok` — renamed to ` n done` in violet, on the UNSEEN flag. The PR ROW's ` n new` (unread comments) is *not* this and stays. | 2026-08-27 |
| **WORKSPACE RUNNING COUNT** | The WORKSPACE TAB briefly counted RUNNING sessions (`workspace_running`); it counts UNSEEN now (`workspace_unseen`). | 2026-08-27 |
| **WRAPPING WALK** | The PANEL WALK used to cycle in both directions; forward now stops at the TERMINAL PANE. | 2026-08-27 |
| **WORKSPACES COLUMN** | The 18-wide left column of WORKSPACES (toggled by `Shift+W`, later draggable) — replaced wholesale by the WORKSPACES BAR in PR #16. `App::workspaces_w` is gone and `leftmost_focus()` became `first_focus()`. | 2026-08-26 |
| **PROJECT DIVIDERS** | Labelled separators between PROJECTS (`-` key, `divider_*` columns). Removed end to end; MIGRATION 18 drops the columns (old migrations must keep spelling them). MOVE PROJECT stayed as a plain reorder until 2026-08-28. | 2026-08-25 |
| **MOVE TO WORKTREE** | The CONTEXT MENU verb + picker (`MenuAction::MoveAgent`) that re-homed a session — replaced by NEBULA WORKTREE and WORKTREE RELOCATION. | 2026-08-26 |
| **TODOS** | The first name of NOTES. | 2026-08-21 |
| **KILL-SERVER** | `nebula kill-server`, renamed to NEBULA KILL. | 2026-08-20 |
| **OLD `h` / `l` / `o` / `t` BINDINGS** | `h` was HOSTS PICKER and `l` was NEW LINK until issue #8 moved them to `Shift+H` / `Shift+L` and gave the letters to FOCUS LEFT / FOCUS RIGHT. NEW LINK was later removed and `Shift+L` unbound; before 2026-08-21 `o` opened NOTES and `t` the TREE BROWSER. | 2026-08-24 |
| **ACTIVE WORKSPACE CHANGED** | `ServerEvent::ActiveWorkspaceChanged` — deleted when the OPEN WORKSPACE became per-connection (STARTUP WORKSPACE). | 2026-08-24 |
| **SECOND PRESS** | The untimed first cut of DOUBLE TAP: any `h`/`l` at a WALK EDGE walked on, so a single `l` at Sessions crossed into the pane. Lived one build; the user wanted the gesture, not the state. | 2026-08-27 |

## 14. Candidates

Names seen in one task so far — a thing that got a name, a word the user used for something with no
TERM yet. Not vocabulary until a later, separate task uses it again; then PROJECT TERMS promotes it to
a row in the section it belongs to and deletes it here. A row whose only sighting is older than 30 days
is pruned. Do not cross-reference a candidate in caps from a TERM row.

| CANDIDATE | What it seems to be | Seen | Where |
|---|---|---|---|
| **RELEASE SNAPSHOT** | Two commits on a scratch branch — S, the SHARED CHECKOUT as it stood at the previous release cut (that release's scratchpad `local.patch` applied to the shared HEAD), and T, the SHARED CHECKOUT now — so `git cherry-pick --no-commit T` onto `origin/main` merges only the post-release delta into the RELEASE WORKTREE. | 2026-08-28 MEMORY "Released v0.15.0 By Cherry-Picking Only The Post-v0.14.0 Delta Onto origin/main" | branch `snap-shared` · `git cherry-pick --no-commit <T>` |
| **CANDIDATES LEDGER** | This section: the holding pen between a name's first sighting and its promotion to a TERM. | 2026-08-28 prompt ("detect vocabulary discoveries … only promote concepts that have actually become canonical") · 2026-08-28 MEMORY "Project Terms: Detect Every Session, Promote Only What Recurred" | `TERMS.md` § 14 · `.claude/skills/project-terms/SKILL.md` |
| **SECURITY REVIEW** | The built-in `security-review` skill run over a PR's diff: one audit sub-agent, then a false-positive pass per finding, reporting only high-confidence vulnerabilities. It snapshots the checkout it runs in — hand it the PR's diff explicitly. | 2026-08-28 prompt ("pr security audit review skill") · 2026-08-28 MEMORY "Fixing A Fork PR's Conflicts From The Shared Tree, Then A Security Audit Of Its Diff" | `Skill(skill: "security-review")` |
| **PR REFRESH ON FOCUS** | The GIT POLL's pull-request lookups (`gh pr list` + `gh pr view`) pulled forward to the next tick when FOCUS lands on the WORKTREES PANEL or SESSIONS PANEL, or the terminal window regains focus (crossterm `FocusGained`), floored by `OPEN_PRS_MIN_AGE` (5 s). | 2026-08-28 prompt ("refresh on focus of the worktrees and sessions in the background") · 2026-08-28 MEMORY "Pull Requests Refresh Every 15 s And On Focus, Not Once A Minute" | `event_loop.rs::schedule_pull_request_refresh` · `note_focus_change` |
| **DONE SOUND** | The ding the TUI plays when an AGENT goes RUNNING / NEEDS FEEDBACK → FINISHED, on screen or not: the `done_sound` SETTING on the SETTINGS OVERLAY's Sessions tab — `off`, `bell` (terminal BEL, silent in Ghostty by default), or a macOS system sound (`Glass` default) via `afplay`; always the bell over NEBULA SSH and off macOS. | 2026-08-28 prompt ("play a ding sound when anything goes into the done status") · 2026-08-28 MEMORY "A DONE SOUND Rings When A Turn Reaches FINISHED, Picked On The Sessions Tab" | `config.rs::DONE_SOUNDS`, `Config::done_sound` · `event_loop.rs::play_done_sound` · `App::pending_ding` |
| **HARNESS TOGGLE** | The per-AGENT KIND `claude_enabled` / `codex_enabled` / `cursor_enabled` SETTING on the AGENTS TAB (on by default); off leaves that harness out of the NEW SESSION PICKER and, for Claude, the PR SESSION launch and the standing PREWARM POOL slot. | 2026-08-28 prompt ("disable harnesses") · 2026-08-28 MEMORY "Harnesses Can Be Switched Off In Settings And Leave The NEW SESSION PICKER" | `config.rs::SettingKind::ClaudeEnabled` · `Config::kind_enabled` |
| **BACKGROUND SUBAGENT** | An Agent-tool worker that Claude Code ≥2.1 keeps running after the foreground turn ends and the input box returns; its SubagentStart/Stop drive the STOP GATE, and its completion re-invokes the main turn. | 2026-08-28 prompt ("sub agents") · 2026-08-28 MEMORY "Background Subagents Turned The Session Green" | `status.rs::mark_idle` |
| **QUIET GRACE** | The 30 min the STOP GATE tolerates tracked subagents with no hook traffic before presuming them orphaned and finishing the turn. | 2026-08-28 MEMORY "Background Subagents Turned The Session Green" | `status.rs::SUBAGENT_QUIET_GRACE` |
| **AGENT PRESET** | A saved launch definition — name, AGENT KIND, MODEL / EFFORT, optional prefix and postfix text — listed by `e` in the SESSIONS PANEL (the list modal), kept in `agent_presets.json` beside CONFIG.JSON, and launched with one task whose prefix + task + postfix becomes the CLI's first prompt; the row it creates is an ordinary AGENT. | 2026-08-28 prompt ("agent modal", "pre-configured agent definition", "prefix and postfix prompts one can sandwhich the request") · 2026-08-28 MEMORY "AGENT PRESETS: `e` Lists Saved Launch Definitions And Starts A SESSION With Prefix + Task + Postfix" | `nebula-tui/src/agent_presets.rs::AgentPreset` · `preset_overlays.rs::AgentPresetsView` · `Action::AgentPresets` · `e` |
| **PRESET EDITOR** | The form behind the list's `a` / `e`: Name, Harness, Model, Effort rows (Tab / ↑↓ between fields, ←/→ cycling a choice) over two multi-line Prefix / Postfix boxes; Enter saves, Esc backs out to the list. | 2026-08-28 MEMORY "AGENT PRESETS: `e` Lists Saved Launch Definitions And Starts A SESSION With Prefix + Task + Postfix" | `preset_overlays.rs::AgentPresetEditor`, `PresetField` |
| **BAR RETURN** | The panel FOCUS came up from into the WORKSPACES BAR — by `k`,`k`, `h`,`h`, Shift+Tab or a click on a tab; Sessions when it came from the TERMINAL PANE — which `j`,`j` in the bar drops back onto with its cursor untouched; Projects until the bar has ever been entered. | 2026-08-28 prompt ("jump back down to the last session you were at") · 2026-08-28 MEMORY "`k`,`k` On A Panel's First Row Jumps Into The WORKSPACES BAR, `j`,`j` There Drops Back Where It Came From" | `app.rs::App::bar_return` · `event_loop/focus_walk.rs::enter_workspaces_bar` / `leave_workspaces_bar` |
| **NEXT STEPS** | The always-present last section of an OUTPUT DOCTOR reply: the hand-off — what is left for the user (commit, PR, a question to answer, a command, a decision) or the single line "Nothing — this is done."; distinct from ACTION REQUIRED, which is the blocking gate above TECHNICAL OVERVIEW. | 2026-08-28 prompt ("a ==== Next Steps ==== section that explains what is left to do for me") · 2026-08-28 reply (v0.17.0 release, OUTPUT DOCTOR section) | `.claude/skills/output-doctor/SKILL.md` |
| **TERMS SUGGEST** | The `fileSuggestion` command behind the `@` picker in every Claude AGENT on this checkout: TERMS matching the typed query (by name or alias) first, repo file paths after; an accepted TERM lands as literal text (`@"WORKSPACES BAR"`), a path attaches as usual. | 2026-08-28 prompt ("use @ for symbols", "try to add it for me") · 2026-08-28 MEMORY "Claude Code Has No Glossary Autocomplete — Only Prefix Pickers, And `fileSuggestion` Is The One Hook" | `.claude/hooks/terms-suggest.py` · `"fileSuggestion"` in `.claude/settings.json` |
